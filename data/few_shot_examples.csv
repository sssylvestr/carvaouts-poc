Reuters – Barclays to Sell Stake in British Payments Business to Brookfield – 17/04/25

Barclays (BARC.L), has agreed terms for Brookfield Asset Management to buy most of its British payments business. Under the complex terms of the deal, the two parties will create a standalone entity for the business, into which Barclays plans to invest approximately 400 million pounds ($528.2 million), Barclays said. The British bank remains the sole shareholder in that unit for the first three years, but Brookfield may acquire an approximately 70% ownership interest, the bank said, on top of its initial 10% stake, and subject to certain conditions.

The company was looking to raise about $34 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai's STAR Market. But the IPO was halted by the China’s financial regulatory authority.

In April 2021, China’s central bank directed Ant Group to undertake a series of restructuring measures that will see Ant turn into a financial holding company, which could curb its profitability and valuation. Ant will now be subjected to tougher regulatory oversight and capital requirements. Ant would also cut any linkage between Alipay, and its credit card and consumer loan services business.

In June 2022, China's central bank accepted Ant Group's application to set up a financial holding company. This signals that the company could get its financial holding license soon and could also pave way to go ahead with its IPO which was cancelled earlier. China’s regulator will examine Ant’s capital strength and business plans before giving a final signoff.";FALSE;region is not relevant, is_co must be False

Software AG's EBIT totaled €12.1 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: €38.2 million) and €74.8 million over the full year (FY 2022: €93.5 million). The Group’s operating EBITA (non-IFRS) amounted to €59.8 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: €73.7 million), giving Software AG an operating margin (EBITA, non-IFRS) of 19.1 percent, down 4 percentage points year-on-year (Q4 2022: 23.1 percent). For the full year, operating EBITA (non-IFRS) was €196.3 million (FY 2022: €193.9 million), resulting in an operating margin (EBITA, non-IFRS) of 19.6 percent, down 0.3 percentage points year-on-year (FY 2022: 19.9 percent). This performance has been mainly impacted by the aforementioned temporary A&N development which has ultimately led to exceeding the targeted guidance range of 16 to 18 percent for 2023. Additionally, during 2023 the Group has successfully pursued its goal to lower costs through various efficiency and productivity initiatives and will continue to do so in 2024.

The Group’s free cash flow totaled €-15.9 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: €-10.2 million) and €-13.1 million (FY 2022: €-1.1 million) for the full year. This development has been mainly driven by one-off costs coming from consultancy and transaction fees in the context of the takeover by Silver Lake.

Employees

As of December 31, 2023, the Group had 4,707 employees worldwide (FTEs); (December 31, 2022: 4,996). This represents a decrease in the Group's employee base of 289, or down 6 percent year-on-year.

Business Update
