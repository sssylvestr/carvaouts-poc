I also hope for a reduction in personal income tax, particularly for the lower-income groups, to provide relief and stimulate demand,\" said Sameer Gupta, National Tax Leader, EY India.\n\nEY said the expectations from Budget are focused on a set of strategic reforms that can propel the economy forward. With an emphasis on fiscal consolidation, tax system simplification, and investment-driven growth, the Budget is expected to lay a solid foundation for sustained economic development.\n\nEY anticipates significant reforms to simplify the tax system and improve taxpayer services, reduce litigation, and enhance tax compliance.\n\nThe government is already working on simplifying the Income Tax laws. It should follow a consultative approach and invite public comments on the draft proposals, EY said.",

Additionally, targeted employment schemes should be fast-tracked to uplift urban demand and support economic momentum in FY26, EY said.",

The increase in classified loans was primarily in the multifamily and industrial CRE loan portfolios, largely due to an increased emphasis in risk grading on current cash flows, and less emphasis on the adequacy of collateral values and the strength of guarantors and sponsors. The increase in classified loans was also attributable to weaker performance, particularly for 2021 and 2022 construction loan vintages, as borrowers missed projections due to longer-than-anticipated lease-up periods, rent concessions, elevated costs, and higher interest rates.

The British soft-drinks group's increased full-year revenue, as well as adjusted profit before tax in line with current market expectations, sets the foundation for the group's five-year ambition to grow sales by a third and adjusted profit before tax by 50% by 2029, they say. \"With strong FCF generation, the group should continue to deliver mid-single digit cash returns to shareholders via regular and special dividends, while also having the firepower for M&A to power further growth,\" the analysts say.

The U.K. real-estate investment trust continues to be attractive, consistently delivering growth in rents, earnings and dividends for its shareholders, Saunders says. \"The company now has serious scale and can expect to eat at the industry top-table for further deals--of which there will surely be--as the market increasingly bifurcates between the best and the rest,\" he says.

Higher interest rates have boosted banks' earnings in recent years, allowing them to reward shareholders with buybacks and dividends. The Asia-focused lender's diversification means it is also well-placed to perform in a falling interest rate environment. \"With the prospect of falling rates and paucity of loan demand, many [net interest income] heavy, asset sensitive banks are reaching for a revenue diversification 'Plan B.' Not so for Standard Chartered,\" Jefferies says in a recent note. This comment highlights its renewed conviction on StanChart's revenue growth prospects from its wealth division and corporate and investment bank.

The U.K. pub operator reported resilient first-quarter trading and strong Christmas sales, Johnson says. He expects full-year operating profit to be 317 million pounds and full-year like-for-like sales growth of around 3.5%. The quarterly results will be a relief for the market but it remains concerned about a clouded macroeconomic outlook, the analyst adds. Mitchells & Butlers shares have fallen 20% since the Labour party won the U.K. general election but have room to grow given the company's market outperformance, cost efficiencies and improving balance sheet.

International Distribution Services, owner of Royal Mail and GLS, said it expects the former to return to an adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2025, and that its parcel volumes went up during the Christmas period. Mould cautions it would be overstating to say that Royal Mail's operation is fully fixed. The postal service company struggled to modernize and boost efficiency due to a fractious relationship with its workers, he adds. IDS shares are barely trading ahead of their 2013 initial public offering price, Mould notes. \"It's hard to give the company's time on the stock market a stamp of approval,\" he says.

The U.K. recruitment company's shares have been among the poorest performers in the sector year-to-date. This performance is a result of consensus downgrades following updates from peers, the analysts note. The results offer some bright spots, including 20% like-for-like quarterly growth in clients at Enterprise solutions, the ongoing focus on efficiency and good cash management. The bank expects Hays to post a pre-exceptional operating profit of around 25 million pounds for the first half, which is towards the lower end of the consensus range.

The housebuilder's three profit warnings highlight systemic issues in cost forecasting and oversight, particularly at its southern division, Tang says. Its internal controls are weaker than peers, with rushed builds and limited site-specific reviews amplifying risks and a focus on short-term targets further straining operational discipline, the analyst says. Still, it has been aggressive in land acquisitions and capitalized on a quieter market to secure strategic opportunities, Tang says. \"These efforts could pay off if planning reforms and housing policy changes create favorable conditions,\" the analyst says.

Amazon could divert parcel volumes from Royal Mail, posing challenges to its revenue, he adds. If Amazon was to expand this service to other parts of London and other large cities, Royal Mail could be forced to adopt additional cost-cutting measures, Paterson says. Royal Mail parcel volumes in its third quarter were 395 million, slightly below Peel Hunt's 404 million estimate. Paterson expects Peel Hunt to trim its forecasts slightly but retain its target price of 360 pence for Royal Mail owner, the London-listed International Distribution Services group.

Still, visibility on when the group will return to growth, the speed at which this can be achieved, and the credible return on capital expenditure in the medium term would be key to supporting the share price, Jefferies says. And this implies the impact of fiscal 2024 result on fiscal 2026--when the market will get an update on mid-term guidance--remains key, the analysts say. Shares are up 8.1% at 556 pence. (anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com)\n\n0925 GMT - Experian's outlook into fiscal 2026 remains very positive, Shore Capital says in a research note. The London-listed credit-reporting agency backed its margin guidance and 6% to 8% organic revenue growth target range for fiscal 2025 alongside its 3Q update. \"The underlying exit rate for group growth we view as likely being at the higher end of the range, with some weak data points in growth likely to recover back toward trend,\" analyst Robin Speakman writes. The company's economic positioning is positive thanks to its breadth of service and steady expansion, which is a key tailwind as data use continues to grow and underpin economies, he says.

Information filed by Alcoa with the SEC can be located by reference to its SEC file number: 001-37816, or its CIK Code: 0001675149. Alcoa's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"AA\" and commenced trading on November 1, 2016. The ticker symbol \"AA\" previously represented Alcoa's former parent corporation, Alcoa, Inc., which was renamed Arconic Inc. following the separation of Alcoa. Accordingly, the common stock of Alcoa has limited historical performance and an investment with a return based on its performance may be more risky than a comparable investment with a return based on the performance of a common stock with a more established record of performance. The future performance of the common stock of Alcoa cannot be predicted based on its historical performance and may bear little or no relation to its historical performance.",

(A-/Stable/F1, A deposit rating) as the cash reserves held at this entity represent the only source of structural CE for these notes and the sudden loss of these funds would imply a downgrade of 10 or more notches. The rating cap reflects the excessive counterparty dependence on the TAB holding the cash reserves, in accordance with Fitch's counterparty criteria.",

This uptick preceded Amazon's new policy requiring employees to work in-office five days a week starting January 2025, up from three days. Previously, rents peaked at nearly $2,500 before the 2020 pandemic, dropping to $1,399 by February 2021 as remote work became prevalent. Post-reopening, demand pushed rents up to $3,118 by August 2022, but they've since fallen by 36% due to increased apartment construction. While longer commutes suggest an impact from Amazon's policy, Redfin says it is premature to link this directly to the rent increase, considering many workers already live close to downtown.

The larger deficit reflects a $10.8 billion rise in goods imports and a $7.8 billion decline in goods exports. Higher imports likely reflect U.S. companies' efforts to ramp up trade at the end of 2024 to get ahead of potential Trump administration tariffs. Most of the rise in imports came in the industrial-supplies category, imports of which grew to $67.05 billion in December, from $56.41 billion a month earlier. The Commerce Department report also showed small declines in wholesale and retail inventories in December versus November.

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties.\n\nMany risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this communication, including, but not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, anticipated tax treatment and unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, pricing trends, future prospects, credit ratings, business and management strategies which may adversely affect each of Synopsys' and Ansys' business, financial condition, operating results and the price of their common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Ansys and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals on the terms expected, in a timely manner, or at all, (iii) the risk that such regulatory approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect, following completion of the proposed transaction (if completed), the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction (including as noted in any forward-looking financial information), (iv) uncertainties as to access to available financing (including any future refinancing of Ansys' or the combined company's debt) to consummate the proposed transaction upon acceptable terms and on a timely basis or at all, (v) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (vi) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on Ansys' or Synopsys' business relationships, competition, business, financial condition, and operating results, (vii) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Ansys or Synopsys and the ability of Ansys or Synopsys to retain and hire key personnel, (viii) risks related to diverting either management team's attention from ongoing business operations of Ansys or Synopsys, (ix) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger agreement or the proposed transaction, (x) the ability of Synopsys to successfully integrate Ansys' operations and product lines, (xi) the ability of Synopsys to implement its plans, forecasts, expected financial performance and other expectations with respect to Ansys' business or the combined business after the completion of the proposed transaction and realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction (if completed) as well as manage the scope and size of the combined company, (xii) the ability of Synopsys to manage additional debt and debt covenants as well as successfully de-lever following the proposed transaction and the outcome of any strategic review and any resulting proposed transactions, (xiii) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction, (xiv) uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, (xv) uncertainty in the growth of the semiconductor, electronics and artificial intelligence industries, (xvi) the highly competitive industries Synopsys and Ansys operate in, (xvii) actions by the U.S. or foreign governments, such as the assessment of fines or the imposition of additional export restrictions or tariffs, (xviii) consolidation among Synopsys' customers and within the industries in which Synopsys operates, as well as Synopsys' dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, (xix) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Ansys and Synopsys operate and (xx) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Ansys' or Synopsys' ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions.

These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Synopsys' and Ansys' control, and are not guarantees of future results. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Synopsys and Ansys assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law. Neither Synopsys nor Ansys gives any assurance that either Synopsys or Ansys will achieve its expectations.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/synopsys-responds-to-the-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-provisionally-accepting-its-proposed-remedies-in-phase-1-regarding-its-proposed-acquisition-of-ansys-302345703.html\n\nSOURCE Synopsys, Inc.\n\n(END)",

         "New Delhi, Jan 8 (PTI) The Budget is expected to focus on boosting private capex, tax simplification and reduction in personal income tax, particularly for the lower-income groups, to stimulate demand, EY India said.\n\nThe Union Budget for 2025-26 is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1.",
         "EY India, in its Budget expectation note, said with over Rs 31 lakh crore stuck in income tax disputes as of 2023-24, there is an urgent need to clear Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) backlog and bolster alternate dispute resolution mechanisms like advance pricing agreements and safe harbours.\n\n\"While a full comprehensive review of the direct tax code may take time, we might see some initial steps towards its implementation in this Budget. I also hope for a reduction in personal income tax, particularly for the lower-income groups, to provide relief and stimulate demand,\" said Sameer Gupta, National Tax Leader, EY India.\n\nEY said the expectations from Budget are focused on a set of strategic reforms that can propel the economy forward. With an emphasis on fiscal consolidation, tax system simplification, and investment-driven growth, the Budget is expected to lay a solid foundation for sustained economic development.\n\nEY anticipates significant reforms to simplify the tax system and improve taxpayer services, reduce litigation, and enhance tax compliance.\n\nThe government is already working on simplifying the Income Tax laws. It should follow a consultative approach and invite public comments on the draft proposals, EY said.\n\n\"Key areas of focus are likely to include enhancing public spending, reducing the fiscal deficit, incentivising private sector investment, and introducing targeted tax reforms that foster business innovation,\" EY said.\n\nIn the last Budget, government had rationalised the capital gains structure in terms of holding period of assets and tax rates. The government may further address some of the unintended anomalies to make the rationalisation of capital gains more complete, EY said.\n\nFor instance, the holding period for capital assets, such as business undertakings in slump sales may be reduced from 36 months to 24 months and unlisted shares in IPO offer for sale (OFS) from 2 years to 1 year, aligning them with listed securities.\n\nGupta further said for businesses, particularly SMEs, reducing the complexity of tax compliance is critical.\n\nTo achieve sustainable growth in FY26, the government must prioritise reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP in FY26 while reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio, which stands at 54.4 per cent, well above the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) target of 40 per cent.\n\nA medium-term real GDP growth target of 6.5 per cent or higher will require boosting the aggregate investment rate (GFCF) measured at constant prices to 34 per cent.\n\nThis can be achieved by increasing the government's capital expenditure, improving capital efficiency and encouraging states to enhance their investment spending.\n\nTo stimulate private sector investment, a progressive reduction in interest rates should be considered. Additionally, targeted employment schemes should be fast-tracked to uplift urban demand and support economic momentum in FY26, EY said.",

         "The iconic retailer could be making major changes to its high street stores 樂\n\n* WHSmith is exploring the sale of its high street arm, which includes around 500 stores",
         "* The company has shifted its focus to its more profitable travel retail business in airports, train stations, and hospitals\n\n* The high street arm contributes just 15% of the group’s annual trading profit\n\n* A sale could impact the future of Post Offices currently operating within WHSmith stores\n\n* WHSmith recently announced plans to close 17 stores, with more closures expected in the coming yearsAn icon of the British high street is in discussions to sell its high street division.\n\nWHSmith’s high street business, comprising around 500 stores, has a history dating back 230 years to the opening of its first shop.\n\n“WHSmith confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options for this profitable and cash generative part of the group, including a possible sale,” a statement said.\n\nOver the past decade, the company has shifted its focus to its more profitable travel retail division, which operates in airports, train stations, and hospitals.\n\nCurrently, the high street segment contributes just 15% of the group’s annual trading profit.\n\n“Over the past decade, WHSmith has become a focused global travel retailer,” the statement continued.\n\n“The group’s travel business has over 1,200 stores across 32 countries, and three-quarters of the group’s revenue and 85% of its trading profit comes from the travel business.”\n\nFor the year ending August 31, WHSmith reported an underlying pre-tax profit of £166 million, up from £143 million the previous year.\n\nWhat does it mean for Post Offices?\n\nIf WHSmith moves forward with selling its high street division, it could lead to significant changes for its stores and associated services, such as Post Offices.\n\nUnder an ownership change, stores may be sold to another retailer or investment group, which could decide to rebrand, restructure, or close underperforming locations.\n\nA personalised morning news round-up with UK Today - sign up here.\n\nIf any new owner finds some stores unviable, closures could follow, particularly in areas with low foot traffic or high operating costs.\n\nA potential buyer could also repurpose or reposition the stores, potentially moving away from WHSmith's traditional offering of books, stationery, and magazines to something more aligned with their business model.\n\nOf course, nothing has been confirmed at this time, and WHSmith has said it is simply “exploring potential strategic options”.\n\n“There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached,” its statement said, “and further updates will be provided as and when appropriate.”\n\nThe fate of Post Offices housed within WHSmith stores would largely depend on the buyer’s plans and any agreements with Post Office Ltd. If the new owner does not wish to continue hosting Post Offices, closures or relocations might occur.\n\nIf stores housing Post Offices were to close or undergo significant changes, local communities could face a temporary or permanent loss of access to postal services in those areas, which would be especially impactful in rural or underserved regions.\n\nThe Post Office may need to find alternative locations for its branches currently within WHSmith stores, which could lead to partnerships with other retailers or stand-alone Post Office branches being established.\n\nAgain, it’s too early to predict exact outcomes, but a sale of the WHSmith’s high street division would likely bring uncertainty to stores and the Post Offices they house.\n\nIn recent years, WHSmith’s focus has intensified on its travel retail division, which has become the core of the company’s success.\n\nWith the high street business potentially sold off, the travel retail division, with over 1,200 stores across 32 countries, could see more international expansion, particularly in airports, train stations, and hospitals, where foot traffic is higher and more lucrative.\n\nWhich stores are closing?\n\nLast week, WHSmith revealed it is set to close 17 stores in the coming months. The retailer has been gradually reducing its footprint, having already closed numerous stores since 2023.\n\nThe latest round of closures, scattered across the country, will take place between now and May.\n\nRead more: WHSmith: iconic high street newsagent brand closing 17 shops amid restructuring\n\nThe announcement follows a statement from November in which the company revealed plans to close up to 20 locations annually over the next three years.\n\nAt the same time, the brand is preparing to expand, with 90 new stores planned for opening during this period.\n\nThe full list of WHSmith store closures is as follows:\n\n* Accrington, Lancashire - March 15\n\n* Basingstoke, Hampshire - February 1\n\n* Bolton, Greater Manchester - February\n\n* Diss, Norfolk - April\n\n* Halesowen, West Midlands - April\n\n* Halstead, Essex - April\n\n* Haverhill, Suffolk - 26 April\n\n* Luton, Bedfordshire - January 18\n\n* March, Cambridgeshire - 25 January\n\n* Newport, Isle of Wight - April\n\n* Newtown, Powys - February 15\n\n* Oldham, Greater Manchester - May\n\n* Orpington, Greater London\n\n* Rhyl, Denbighshire - February 15\n\n* Stockton, County Durham - May\n\n* Winton, Bournemouth - February 15 Many of the stores set to close have launched \"everything-must-go\" sales, so if one is shutting near you, it might be worth checking it out for some great deals.\n\nWhat do you think about WHSmith's potential sale of its high street arm? How do you feel this might impact local communities and the future of Post Offices within the stores? Share your thoughts in the comments section.",

With a solid professional user base now in place, PLAUD.AI is expanding into the enterprise space with solutions that drive greater efficiency and productivity for businesses.\n\nThe intelligence platform enables teams to: \n\n\n   -- Transform note-taking and documentation processes through advanced AI \n      automation \n \n   -- Create an efficient workflow and collaborative workspace for team \n      productivity \n \n   -- Extract actionable intelligence from meetings and conversations \n\nThese power solutions serve professionals across diverse sectors, including field sales, healthcare professionals, legal practitioners, headhunters, technicians, and beyond.\n\nPLAUD for Business meets the highest enterprise security and data privacy standards, including HIPAA and SOC 2, among other security frameworks. The data protection commitment makes PLAUD.AI a trusted partner for individual and enterprise users.\n\n\"We've been listening carefully to our users, and there's been an overwhelming demand for enterprise-level solutions that allow teams to collaborate through a unified intelligence platform and tailor-made capabilities,\" said Nathan Hsu, Co-Founder and CEO of PLAUD.AI. \"Professionals aren't just looking to enhance their individual productivity--they want tools that can capture collective intelligence and transform how entire organizations work together. That's exactly what drove this acquisition and the creation of PLAUD for Business.\"\n\nStarJar Founders Joining PLAUD.AI\n\nFollowing the acquisition, StarJar's two co-founders, Ruming Zhen and Qi Zhang, will join PLAUD.AI to lead the development of PLAUD for Business, slated for official launch in the summer of 2025.\n\nRuming Zhen is an accomplished AI and software professional with an impressive background. A Stanford graduate, he previously held product leadership roles at Tesla and Intuit. Qi Zhang brings deep expertise in software engineering and AI development, having spent nearly a decade at Amazon, where he contributed to several of the company's most innovative initiatives.\n\nThe duo began their entrepreneurial journey in medical AI in 2023. Invited by PLAUD, they are now joining forces to build the next-generation enterprise AI note-taking solution. Unlike other software-only AI note-taking tools on the market, PLAUD's solution leverages dedicated sensors to capture conversations in multiple scenarios, unlocking previously untapped real-life data and creating tremendous incremental value.\n\nExpands Vision with Strategic Developer Platform Investment\n\nPLAUD.AI has also begun significant engineering investments to build a comprehensive developer platform with APIs and SDKs. This platform will enable AI companies and clients to build solutions on top of PLAUD's intelligence infrastructure, which encompasses hardware, software, cloud services, and AI capabilities. Yijia Zhang, former founder and CEO of Lingxin Intelligent and an early member of Google's Assistant and Android Auto team, has recently joined PLAUD.AI to lead these engineering efforts.\n\nAbout PLAUD.AI\n\nPLAUD.AI is building the next generation of intelligence infrastructure and interface from what you hear, say, and see. Its unified infrastructure seamlessly integrates hardware, software, cloud services, and AI capabilities. Through three distinct interfaces--prosumer products, enterprise solutions, and an OS-level developer platform--PLAUD.AI is transforming how the world captures, extracts, and utilizes intelligence from both digital and real-life interactions.\n\nFor more information, visit the PLAUD.AI website, or follow PLAUD.AI on Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Instagram, YouTube.\n\nJoin the winning team: Explore moonshot positions from LinkedIn.\n\nMedia kit & interview requests: hi@plaud.ai\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plaudai-acquires-yc-backed-starjar-to-power-its-new-enterprise-solution-plaud-for-business-302428716.html\n\nSOURCE PLAUD.AI\n\n(END)",

Integrated Report 2024\n\nMessage from the Senior Executive Officer in charge of the Healthcare Business Supervisory Unit\n\nAiming for topline growth as All SHIONOGI\n\nSHIONOGI has set a goal of 800 billion yen in revenue by fiscal 2030 in STS2030 Revision, and global growth is key to achieving this goal. To this end, in April 2024, we reorganized the Healthcare Business Supervisory Unit to be responsible for all of SHIONOGI's sales, including Shionogi Inc. (SI: U.S.), Shionogi B.V. (SBV: Europe), Ping An-Shionogi (PSCN: China), Taiwan Shionogi and other group companies in Asia, and Shionogi Healthcare, which is responsible for the OTC drug business. This has enabled us to oversee a series of operations from marketing to sales, and we have established a system that allows us to formulate and execute optimal strategies for each country, taking into account time frames such as current, short-term and medium- to long- term, as well as regional characteristics.\n\n* We will continue to develop our healthcare business globally, covering presymptomatic care, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, with infectious diseases as our main focus area. Furthermore, we will not only focus on traditional small-molecule drugs but also utilize new modalities such as digital apps to fulfill our role as a healthcare provider. In fiscal 2024, we aim to grow our top line by focusing on the growth of our domestic prescription drug business centered on Xocova and Xofluza, further overseas expansion of Xocova and Fetroja, and maximizing newly approved products and the OTC drug business.\n\nToshinobu Iwasaki, Ph.D.\n\nSenior Executive Officer,\n\nSenior Vice President,\n\nHealthcare Business Supervisory Unit\n\nShionogi & Co., Ltd.

On the other hand, as we have experienced firsthand with the COVID-19 pandemic, when a pandemic occurs, society suffers greatly, and we have learned the importance of being prepared in normal times. To continue promoting the acute infectious disease business, which is essential for the world, SHIONOGI is working to establish a sustainable business model in a highly uncertain market by leveraging our strengths in the infectious disease area.\n\n* For example, from 2023 to 2024, influenza and COVID- 19 repeated alternating or simultaneous outbreaks. If we\n\nTrend in the number of reports per fixed point for infectious diseases in Japan\n\nonly had a treatment drug for one infectious disease, revenue would decrease with the end of the outbreak, but by having two acute infectious disease drugs - an anti-influenza treatment and a COVID-19 treatment - we achieved stable revenue. In the future, we will realize a sustainable business model for acute infectious diseases that is not affected by outbreaks by preparing treatment drugs for multiple viruses, including RSV, and combining solutions such as prevention and diagnosis, not just treatment drugs.\n\nDistribution start and regular approval of Xocova\n\nXocova received emergency approval in November 2022, and due to its high medical necessity, distribution began under government purchase. Initially, because the drug was under the special circumstances of emergency approval, prescriptions were only allowed at some registered facilities. Also, prescriptions required paper-based patient consent documents, which carried a risk of infec-\n\nNumber of reports per fixed point (people)\n\n30\n\n10\n\n0 May\n\nJun.\n\nJul. Aug. Sep. Oct.

Therefore, we worked to build evidence to clarify the value of taking Xocova and established an online consent method using smartphones to reduce the risk of infection. As a result, the convenience of the drug itself, which can be used regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors for severe illness, and efforts to reduce the risk of infection during medical care were appreciated, and after the start of general distribution in March 2023, Xocova has been delivered to more medical institutions and is widely used. In addition, based on safety data from more than 900,000 patients accumulated during the emergency\n\nCOVID-19 Influenza\n\nStable revenue structure achieved by having two drugs:\n\ninfluenza treatment and COVID-19 treatment\n\napproval period, efficacy, and favorable results from Phase 3 trials conducted in Asia (mainly Japan), we obtained regular approval in March 2024.\n\nOffer total care globally that goes beyond medicines building a sustainable business model\n\nBuild a business portfolio that is      Build a sustainable\nnot affected by epidemics               business model\n                                         \n                                         \nRealize total care platform for acute   Establish a purchase model in collab-\ninfectious diseases                     oration with government, etc.\n                                         \n\n\nBuild a disease portfolio\n\nMake wide-ranging efforts to tackle upper respiratory tract infections\n\nExample initiative, COVID-19\n\n           COVID-19\n           Influenza\nDiagnosis  RSV infections\n\n\n                                                                                                                          etc.\n                                                                                                        Exacerbation\n                                                                                                                         \nEpidemic forecasting                   Prevention               Treatment                               suppression        \n                                                  Aftereffect                        \n                                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                        suppression        \n                                                                                                                           \nProvide wastewater                                                                                      Establish joint   Conduct joint sales and pro-\n                        Create Covgoze            Create Xocova                     research lecture on  \nsurveillance services                                           post-infection syn-                     motion of antigen test kits\n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                        drome treatment    \n                                                                                                                           \n\n\n50\n\nShionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2024\n\nPromoting proper use and realizing early diagnosis and early treatment\n\nFor acute respiratory infections, it is important to eliminate pathogens early through early diagnosis and early treatment to prevent worsening prognosis. SHIONOGI provides Xocova as an acute infectious disease treatment drug, as well as Xofluza and Rapiacta as anti-influenza treatments. Furthermore, we are also co-promoting the ImunoAce series used for diagnosis of these diseases.\n\n* In the future, we will continue to promote the proper use of these products and realize early diagnosis and early treatment to contribute to patients suffering from influ- enza and COVID-19.\n\nDomestic sales and information provision of Fetroja started\n\nThe antimicrobial resistance (AMR) problem is a social issue that requires urgent attention on a global scale and should be addressed with high priority. To save patients with AMR infections, it is essential to use antibiotics effective against AMR, but on the other hand, to prevent new AMR from developing, it is important to use them minimally after identifying patients who need them. Against this background, we started providing drug susceptibility test reagents (for research use) simultaneously with the domestic launch of Fetroja in December 2023, preparing for susceptibility testing of bacteria to this drug promptly after launch. Additionally, Fetroja was selected as the first target drug for the new antibiotic securing support project trial introduced by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare as part of AMR countermea- sures. This project aims to promote AMR countermeasures by creating a mechanism where the government provides a certain amount of support for the revenue decrease that companies incur when they cooperate with the national AMR measures (maintaining appropriate sales volume levels) while encouraging the development of antibiotics.\n\n* SHIONOGI will continue to provide next-generation drugs by promoting the proper use of antibiotics and ensuring business sustainability to contribute to solving the AMR problem.\n\nStrengthening the sales system using IT and\n\nDX\n\nDue to the spread of COVID-19 infections and work style reforms for doctors, the methods of obtaining information sought by healthcare professionals are diversifying. To respond to these diversifying needs, SHIONOGI is developing a system and utilizing data to provide information with a good balance between digital channels and real information provision activities. As part of developing an information provision system that utilizes digital technology, we renewed our website for healthcare professionals in June 2023. We have built a platform that aggregates information needed in medical settings for the products we handle and their disease areas, allowing healthcare professionals to search efficiently.\n\n* Additionally, in order to provide timely information tai- lored to each customer's needs, we are developing a foun- dation that can centrally manage internal and external data and advancing various analyses. In particular, by intro- ducing a customer management system, we have built a customer-centric environment that visualizes information provision activities conducted by SHIONOGI, regardless of digital or real, in a timely manner. Currently, we are strengthening the data linkage function for overall infor- mation provision activities to deliver necessary information at appropriate times for each customer.\n\n* Furthermore, through Stream-I, Inc., a joint venture with M3, Inc., which operates the medical portal site m3.com, we are also working on building an AI-powered informa- tion provision model. We will strive to understand customer needs in a timely manner and provide appropriate informa- tion by analyzing various internal and external information.\n\nSHIONOGI\n\nStory 2\n\nSolving Social Issues through\n\nFOCUS 1 Message from an employee\n       \n\n\nEfforts towards regular approval of Xocova\n\nAs Xocova was the first drug approved under the emergency approval system, there was no precedent for the necessary application materials for transitioning from emergency approval to regular approval, and we needed to consult with the authorities multiple times. Furthermore, there were many issues that needed to be addressed simultaneously, such as switching from a national purchase product to a drug price listing, packaging label require- ments, and periodic side effect monitoring at the safety measures committee and corresponding responses. We considered countermeasures while cooperating and collaborating with many departments within the Company, responded quickly, and obtained regular approval on March 5, 2024. In the future, we will continue to contribute to the treatment of COVID-19 by providing medical professionals with a large amount of clinical data, including the effects of this drug on symptom improvement and viral reduction.\n\nChie Kishimoto\n\nVice President,\n\nRegulatory Affairs Department\n\nOur Business Activities and Creating Value for the Future\n\nShionogi & Co., Ltd.

AdvanSentinel Inc. is developing a wastewater surveillance service that moni- tors pathogens in wastewater, and is contributing to society by working with relevant ministries and multiple local gov- ernments to grasp the infection situation and provide infor- mation. On the other hand, in Asian countries including Japan, wastewater surveillance is not yet fully developed, and further advancement in research is necessary toward future social implementation. Therefore, to establish the technical foundation for wastewater surveillance and widely disseminate efforts toward its social implementation\n\nto the world, we established the Laboratory of International Wastewater-based Epidemiology as a social collaboration course at the University of Tokyo in March 2024, together with Shimadzu Corporation.\n\n* In addition, SHIONOGI has started providing new services such as the gamma wave sound TV speaker kikippa and the service for elementary and junior high school teachers, Yui-EN. To make such services widely useful, it is important not only to develop the services themselves but also to work toward social implementation. As we are doing with wastewater surveillance services, we aim to provide health- care services that go beyond just providing pharmaceuti- cals according to customer needs in each phase of pre-illness care, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prog- nosis by advancing development and efforts toward social implementation in parallel.\n\n*1 Healthcare solutions other than pharmaceuticals and vaccines\n\n*2 Healthcare as a Service: Providing various healthcare services according to customer needs, not limited to providing pharmaceuticals\n\nNew business list\n\nName of product/service Summary of product/service\n                        Wastewater surveillance service                           Visualization of infection risks through early detection of  \n                         \n                        infectious diseases, epidemic forecasting, and monitoring  \n                                                                                  of the prevalence of mutant genes                            \n                                                                                                                                               \n\n\nProducts and services currently offered\n\nGamma wave sound TV speaker       A speaker that converts TV sound into gamma wave              \nkikippa                           sound, aiming to improve the quality of life for the elderly  \n                                                                                                \n                                                                                                \nElementary and junior high school Supporting classroom management by proposing teach-           \n                                  \n\nclass management support system   ing methods suited to individual students and sharing         \nYui-EN                            them with other teachers                                      \n\n\nFOCUS 2 Yui Connection Co., Ltd.\n          Message from the President of\n           \n\n\nAiming for a society where everyone can play an active role\n\nSince the start of our business in October 2022, we have been delivering the Yui-EN service for elementary and junior high school teachers to educational sites. Yui-EN automatically analyzes the needs of school life from the results of a multifaceted and multidimensional assessment of 82 items covering physical, emotional, lifestyle, and learning aspects of stu- dents, and presents an educational guidance plan tailored to each student's individuality.\n\n* The deep understanding of students gained from the 82-item assessment enables aware- ness of changes in students and sharing of perspectives. This is then used for smooth infor- mation handover during grade advancement and school transitions, and for collaborative guidance and response by teachers.\n\n* In educational settings, teachers enhance each other's diverse experiences synergistically and connect them to the growth and learning of students. By adding support through Yui-EN, an educational guidance plan tailored to each individual's uniqueness, we believe it is possible to provide value that is more closely aligned with students and their parents. Through this cycle, we will create and provide society with Yui Connection's unique value of nurturing growth where everyone's individuality is utilized and everyone can shine and play an active role in society without exception.\n\nShuichi Takano\n\nPresident\n\nYui Connection Co., Ltd.\n\n52\n\nShionogi & Co., Ltd.

Since its spin-off in April 2016, it has been steadily growing while expanding its business areas.\n\n* As we seek to realize the SHIONOGI Group Vision, amidst the recent increase in self-care demand, we are actively promoting the launch of switch products from prescription drugs to OTC drugs and new initiatives such as kikippa, focusing on the areas of infectious diseases, skin, pain, and healthcare services. In fiscal 2023, due to the intermittent outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the year, sales of the Pro series for infectious disease control (Pylon PL Granules Pro, Medicon Cough Suppressant Tablets Pro, Mucodyne Expectorant Tablets Pro) remained steady. As a result, in fiscal 2023, Shionogi Healthcare achieved growth for the fifth consecutive term and recorded its highest ever performance.\n\nPerformance trends of Shionogi Healthcare\n\n(Millions of yen)\n\n14,708\n\nRevenue\n\n322% growth\n\nPromotion of self-medication\n\nWe believe that as global aging progresses and self-care becomes increasingly important from a social security per- spective, raising individual awareness of health management will become more crucial. Shionogi Healthcare, with the business concept of Gentle and precise self-care for all people, will contribute to extending healthy life expectancy worldwide not only by providing quality and safety-focused OTC drugs and health foods but also by promoting easy-to- use universal design and new healthcare services.\n\nExpansion of switch OTC drug lineup\n\nAs awareness of self-medication increases, we have been leading the OTC drug industry by launching switch OTC drugs such as Rinderon Vs, Pylon PL Granules Pro, and Medicon Cough Suppressant Tablets Pro since fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2023, we have expanded our lineup to meet the needs for infectious disease control for cold symptoms, coughs, and phlegm by adding the new switch OTC drug Mucodyne Expectorant Tablets Pro to the Pro series of infectious disease brands (Pylon PL Granules Pro, Medicon Cough Suppressant Tablets Pro).

For more information, see the press release dated July 29, 2024, titled Torex Gold Provides Q2 2024 Update on Media Luna Project. Both releases can be found on the Company's website, www.torexgold.com.\n\n2) Gold equivalent (\"AuEq\") production includes gold (\"Au\") and AuEq values for silver (\"Ag\") and copper (\"Cu\") sold using the market prices summarized in footnote 3 (payable production by metal are provided in Table 2).\n\n3) 2025 guidance assumes average market prices of $2,500/oz Au, $28/oz Ag, and $4.30/lb Cu as well as a Mexican peso (\"MXN\") to U.S. dollar (\"USD\") of 20:1 (key sensitivities to changes in Au, Cu, and MXN:USD are provided in Table 5).\n\n4) These measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" in the Company's September 30, 2024 MD&#38;A for further information and a detailed reconciliation. See also the Cautionary Notes to this press release.\n\na) All-in sustaining costs (AuEq) in 2024 have averaged $1,205 per ounce AuEq sold through Q3.\n\nb) Sustaining capital expenditures in 2024 have totaled $51.0 million through Q3.\n\nc) Non-sustaining capital expenditures in 2024 have totaled $356.1 million through Q3.\n\n5) Sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditures include drilling and exploration related expenditures (see Table 3).\n\nJody Kuzenko, President and CEO of Torex, stated:\n\n\"2025 will be a pivotal year for Torex with the conclusion of the Media Luna Project only a few months away, marking the start of our next chapter at Morelos. For the first time, we will have simultaneous production from both the north and south sides of the Balsas River, and we will also become a meaningful copper (\"Cu\") producer with the metal representing approximately 20% of the guided 2025 production. The lower guided production compared to 2024 reflects four weeks of downtime at the processing plant while we complete the tie-ins for Media Luna. Production is expected to increase in 2026, holding at 450,000 to 500,000 gold equivalent ounces (\"oz AuEq\") through 2030 on the reserve case, with considerable exploration upside remaining.\n\n\"All-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher in 2025 on account of the lower production and fewer economies of scale, which we expect to gain as mining at Media Luna ramps up and cost efficiencies are attained. All-in sustaining costs guidance of $1,400 to $1,600 per oz AuEq sold also reflects the impact of higher forecast metal prices on royalties and profit-sharing with 2025 guidance assuming a gold (\"Au\") price of $2,500 per ounce (\"oz\") versus 2024 guidance of $1,900 per oz. All-in sustaining costs are expected to improve throughout the year with fourth quarter costs anticipated to be towards the lower end of the guided range. Costs are expected to improve further in 2026 and 2027 as Media Luna ramps up, production increases, and efficiencies are gained.\n\n\"On the drilling and exploration front, we are planning to invest $45 million, representing 50% more than was spent in 2024, with a focus on expanding resources, replacing reserves, and drill-testing several high-priority targets. On project development, we plan to invest $30 to $35 million this year in EPO, which remains on track for first production in late 2026. This investment includes driving an exploration decline, which will allow us to more efficiently upgrade and convert resources at this newest mining front.\n\n\"Capital expenditures are expected to materially decline year-over-year with the completion of Media Luna in the first quarter. With our usual seasonality of cash flow, after accounting for outflows related to tax, royalty, and profit-sharing payments during the first half of the year, we expect to return to positive free cash flow mid-year. Free cash flow from the business will be used for growth, to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance return of capital, with the previously announced share buyback program likely to be complemented by a sustainable dividend that can grow over time.\n\n\"With first production from Media Luna in the coming months, strong free cash flow generation, and development starting at EPO, we are looking forward to the exciting year ahead as we build on the operational track record we have established, continue to generate strong returns for our shareholders, and solidify our production profile for decades to come.\"\n\nStarting in 2025, Torex will primarily report payable production, sales, and all-in sustaining costs on an AuEq basis which reflects the projected increase in Cu and silver (\"Ag\") production with the start-up of Media Luna. Production and sales by individual metal will continue to be reported, as will by-product all-in sustaining costs for 2025. AuEq values will be based on average market prices for Au, Ag, and Cu.\n\n2025 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE\n\nPayable production in 2025 is guided at 400,000 to 450,000 oz AuEq compared to 460,000 to 480,000 oz AuEq guided in 2024. The lower production year-over-year reflects four weeks of scheduled downtime in the processing plant during the first quarter to complete upgrades and tie-ins related to the Media Luna Project.\n\nTABLE 2: 2025 PAYABLE PRODUCTION BY METAL\n\n                   Gold (koz) Silver (koz)   Copper (Mlb)\nPayable production 300 to 350 1,600 to 1,800 40 to 45\n\n\nApproximately 75% of AuEq payable production guidance in 2025 is expected to come from Au, 20% from Cu, and the remainder from Ag. AuEq production is guided on forecast metal prices of $2,500/oz Au, $28/oz Ag, and $4.30/lb Cu.\n\nPrior to the four-week shutdown, the processing plant will continue to treat ore from ELG Open Pit and ELG Underground while ore from Media Luna is stockpiled. Following the shutdown, the primary sources of feed for the processing plant will come from Media Luna and ELG Underground, with stockpiles processed as required.\n\nGiven plans to maintain an aggressive pace of underground development and delineation drilling throughout 2025, the Company is targeting to exit the year at a mining rate of 6,500 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") at Media Luna and achieve the designed mining rate of 7,500 tpd by mid-2026, approximately six months ahead of the schedule outlined in the March 2022 Technical Report. Mining rates at ELG Underground are expected to average more than 2,800 tpd during 2025 given the plan to leverage long-hole open stoping within steeper zones of the underground mine. While cut-and-fill is expected to remain the primary mining method at ELG, the Company will continue to look at opportunities to further leverage long-hole open stoping where applicable.\n\nAuEq payable production is expected to be the lowest during the first quarter given the four-week shutdown of the processing plant and lower processed grades with depletion of main El Limón open pit in late 2024. Production during the remaining quarters is expected to be relatively consistent. AuEq sales are expected to be more back-end weighted given a majority of revenue starting in the second quarter will come from precious metal rich Cu concentrate, for which there is a longer lag time between production and sales relative to doré.\n\n2025 ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS GUIDANCE\n\nAll-in sustaining costs are guided at $1,400 to $1,600 per oz AuEq sold during 2025. The higher costs relative to 2024 include the impact of lower guided production, higher unit costs during the initial ramp-up of Media Luna, and higher metal prices than realized in 2024.\n\n* Lower production year-over-year: The lower annual production due to the four-week shutdown of the processing plant is forecast to impact all-in sustaining costs by $70 per oz AuEq relative to 2024.\n\n* Higher metal prices year-over-year: 2025 guidance is based on an Au price of $2,500 per oz, which is expected to impact all-in sustaining costs by $65 per oz AuEq including higher royalties and impact on AuEq production related to the stronger gold price relative to copper. Guidance also includes the impact of the recent increase in the government-based royalty on Au and Ag to 1.0% from 0.5%. Note that the Mexican mining royalty has also increased to 8.5% from 7.5% but does not impact all-in sustaining costs as it is accounted for as an income tax.\n\n* Economies of scale during Media Luna ramp-up: Lower economies of scale from Media Luna during the ramp-up period are projected to temporarily impact all-in sustaining costs by approximately $50 per oz AuEq, with costs expected to improve as underground mining rates at Media Luna reach the designed 7,500 tpd by mid-2026.\n\nThe wider guided range relative to previous years reflects the first year of production from Media Luna as well as the potential for continued strength in underlying metal prices, which can also have an impact on AuEq production and therefore all-in sustaining costs, depending on the price performance of Cu and Ag relative to Au. Corporate G&#38;A (normalized for marked-to-market adjustments for stock-based compensation) and reclamation and remediation costs are expected to be similar to the levels incurred in 2024.\n\nAll-in sustaining costs are expected to be the highest during the first half of the year, before declining sequentially through the third and fourth quarters as production increases and economies of scale are gained as Media Luna ramps up. As such, quarterly all-in sustaining costs are expected to be above the upper end of the range during the first half of the year before declining towards the lower end of the range by year end. Further cost improvements are expected in 2026 and 2027 as annual production increases to over 450,000 oz AuEq, Media Luna reaches steady state, and efficiencies are gained.\n\n2025 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE GUIDANCE\n\nTotal capital expenditures in 2025 are guided at $175 to $195 million, significantly lower than the $495 to $530 million guided in 2024. The lower spend year-over-year reflects the completion of the Media Luna Project in the first quarter.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures are guided at $85 to $95 million in 2025 compared to $55 to $65 million in 2024. The increase relative to 2024 reflects spend associated with Media Luna. Sustaining capital expenditures also include $20 million in equipment leases, mostly related to Media Luna, as well as approximately $14 million allocated to drilling.\n\nTotal non-sustaining capital expenditures are guided at $90 to $100 million in 2025, significantly lower than the $440 to $465 million guided in 2024 given the completion of Media Luna. Approximately $30 to $35 million of expenditures are earmarked for EPO, for which underground development off the Guajes Tunnel is expected to commence mid-year. As part of the EPO program, a $5 million exploration drift off South Portal Upper will be driven to the north. This drift will allow for more efficient and cost-effective drilling from underground, provide access to the upper portion of the deposit, and potentially provide access to the northern extension of EPO. The remainder of non-sustaining capital expenditures are related to the completion of Media Luna (primarily during the pre-commercial period) as well as approximately $5 million allocated to drilling.\n\n2025 DRILLING &#38; EXPLORATION PLANS\n\nTorex plans to invest approximately $45 million in drilling and exploration in 2025. In total, 124,500 metres (\"m\") of drilling is planned during the year with the goal of increasing reserves and resources to maintain annual production of at least 450,000 oz AuEq beyond 2030. Of the planned drilling metres, approximately 30% is planned at targets for which no mineral resource has yet been established including Media Luna West, Media Luna East, Todos Santos, El Naranjo, and Atzcala.\n\nWhile the primary focus of the 2025 program is on increasing resources and growing reserves from existing deposits, a greater portion of the overall budget will be focused on testing high-priority targets within the Media Luna Cluster as well as the broader Morelos Property:\n\n* Media Luna Cluster: $26 million is earmarked for drilling at the Media Luna Cluster (66,500 m)\n\n* EPO (27,000 m) will remain the key focus in 2025 as the Company looks to expand mineral resources to the north and upgrade mineral resources with the aim of bringing into mineral reserves;\n\n* Media Luna (14,500 m) will see an increased focus in 2025, with step-out drilling targeting to expand mineral resources and infill drilling targeting to replace mined reserves;\n\n* Drilling at Media Luna West (10,000 m) will continue with the goal of establishing an initial Inferred Resource by year end. An inaugural program at Media Luna East (10,000 m) will commence in the second half of the year following the successful negotiation of a land access agreement with the local Ejido;\n\n* The inaugural drill program at Todos Santos (5,000 m) will carry over to 2025 following a slower start than anticipated in 2024.\n\n* ELG Underground: Approximately $12 million of expenditures are anticipated at ELG Underground (48,000 m) in 2025 with the focus remaining on expanding resources and growing reserves.\n\n* Morelos District: Approximately $7 million is allocated to conduct near-mine and regional exploration and drilling (10,000 m). The main areas of focus of the 2025 regional program will be drill testing a cluster of mineralization at El Naranjo (5,000 m) as well as testing several targets in the Atzcala corridor (5,000 m). Target definition work will also continue across the broader Morelos Property.\n\nTABLE 3: 2025 DRILLING AND EXPLORATION FORECAST\n\n                  Expensed Sustaining Capex Non-Sustaining Capex Total\nExpenditures (M$) $26      $14              $5                   $45\nDrilling (m)      54,000   55,500           15,000               124,500\n\n\n1) Sustaining and non-sustaining portions of drilling and exploration forecast included in full-year guidance for sustaining capital expenditures ($85 to $95 million) and non-sustaining capital expenditures ($90 to $100 million)\n\nFIVE-YEAR PRODUCTION OUTLOOK (2025 TO 2029)\n\nThe Company's multi-year outlook has been updated for the lower guided AuEq production in 2025, reflecting the previously announced deferral of the four-week processing plant shutdown to early 2025 from late 2024. In addition, annual guidance for 2026 has been upwardly revised from 425,000 to 475,000 oz AuEq to 450,000 to 500,000 oz AuEq, reflecting the expectation that Media Luna will achieve the designed mining rate of 7,500 tpd six months ahead of schedule. The multi-year outlook now also includes the inaugural AuEq production estimate for 2029.\n\nWith the ramp-up of Media Luna and start-up of EPO expected in late 2026, Torex is well-positioned to maintain annual AuEq payable production of at least 450,000 oz through 2030 based on current mineral reserves. The current outlook is consistent with the disclosure provided with the release of the internal pre-feasibility study results on the EPO deposit in September 2024.\n\nTABLE 4: FIVE-YEAR GOLD EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OUTLOOK FOR THE MORELOS COMPLEX1\n\n20242 (Actuals) 20253      2026       2027       2028       2029\n461             400 to 450 450 to 500 450 to 500 450 to 500 450 to 500\n\n\n1) Payable AuEq production is based on the same metal prices used to estimate year-end 2023 mineral reserves ($1,500/oz Au, $19/oz Ag, and $3.50/lb Cu).\n\n2) 2024 AuEq production is based on actual realized pricing of $2,386/oz for Au, $4.15/lb for Cu, and $28.26/oz for Ag.\n\n3) 2025 production guidance assumes metal prices of $2,500/oz Au, $28/oz Ag, and $4.30/lb Cu.\n\nA breakdown of the Company's mineral reserves and resources as at December 31, 2023 can be found in the press release dated March 26, 2024, titled Torex Gold Reports Year-End 2023 Reserves &#38; Resources. A breakdown of the inaugural mineral reserve estimate for EPO can be found in the press release dated September 4, 2024, titled Torex Gold Integrates EPO Deposit into Morelos Mine Plan. Both releases can be found on the Company's website, www.torexgold.com.\n\nCASH FLOW SEASONALITY\n\nCash flow seasonality will be more pronounced during 2025 given anticipation of lower production during the first quarter and working capital builds related to selling precious metal rich Cu concentrate, given the need to build adequate levels of inventory prior to initial revenue recognition.\n\nSimilar to prior years, cash flow during the first quarter will be impacted by the payment of the 7.5% Mexican mining royalty (accrued throughout the year and paid out the following March) and corporate income tax true-up at year end, which, given profitability in 2024, is expected to be higher than previous years. Taxes paid will be reflected in net cash generated from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital. During the second quarter, net cash generated from operating activities will be impacted by the employee profit-sharing payment (\"PTU\") which is accrued throughout the year and paid out in full in May of the following year.\n\nSENSITIVITIES OF KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS TO COMMODITY PRICES AND CURRENCY\n\nTable 5 provides a high-level sensitivity on key metrics (AuEq production, all-in sustaining costs, and cash flow) to changes in metal price assumptions (Au and Cu) as well as movements in the Mexican peso (\"MXN\") relative to the U.S. dollar (\"USD\").\n\nTABLE 5: SENSITIVITIES OF KEY METRICS TO MARKET-BASED DRIVERS1\n\n                             Payable Production (koz AuEq) AISC ($/oz AuEq sold) Net Cash Generated from Operating Activities\nGold price (+/- $200/oz)     -/+ 8                         +/- $60/oz            +/- $55M\nCopper price (+/- $0.25/lb)  +/- 4                         -/+ $15/oz            +/- $10M\nMXN:USD (+/- 1.00)           n/a                           -/+ $30/oz            +/- $10M\n\n\n1) 2025 guidance assumes average market prices of $2,500/oz for Au, $28/oz for Ag, and $4.30/lb for Cu as well as a MXN:USD of 20:1.\n\nThe midpoint of cost guidance for 2025 assumes an average MXN to USD of 20:1 for the full year. The Company currently has hedges (a mix of collars and forwards) in place to cover off $144 million of MXN-related operating costs in 2025 with $100 million hedged through zero-cost collars (average floor of 19.7 and cap of 21.6), with the remaining hedges placed as forward contracts at an average rate of 21.0. Realized gains/losses will be included in the calculation of all-in sustaining costs.\n\nIn addition, given the transitional and ramp-up nature of 2025, the Company recently took advantage of attractive pricing to purchase put options covering 155,000 oz of Au production in 2025 with a strike price of $2,500 per oz. The puts provide downside price protection while providing full exposure to upward movements in the price of Au.\n\nABOUT TOREX GOLD RESOURCES INC.\n\nTorex is an intermediate gold producer based in Canada, engaged in the exploration, development, and operation of its 100% owned Morelos Property, an area of 29,000 hectares in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt located 180 kilometres southwest of Mexico City. The Company's principal asset is the Morelos Complex, which includes the El Limón Guajes (\"ELG\") Mine Complex, the Media Luna Project, a processing plant, and related infrastructure. Commercial production from the Morelos Complex commenced on April 1, 2016 and an updated Technical Report for the Morelos Complex was released in March 2022. Torex's key strategic objectives are: integrate and optimize the Morelos Property; deliver Media Luna to full production; grow reserves and resources; disciplined growth and capital allocation; retain and attract best industry talent; and build on ESG excellence.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\n\nTOREX GOLD RESOURCES INC.\n\nJody Kuzenko\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nDirect: (647) 725-9982\n\njody.kuzenko@torexgold.com\n\nDan Rollins\n\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Development &#38; Investor Relations\n\nDirect: (647) 260-1503\n\ndan.rollins@torexgold.com\n\nQUALIFIED PERSON\n\nThe technical and scientific information in this press release, with respect to the Company's mine production and payable metal production, including without limitation, the 2025 production guidance and the five-year production outlook, has been reviewed and approved by Richard Jundis, P. Eng, Principal Mining Engineer, Technical Services and Capital Projects of the Company, and a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101.\n\nCAUTIONARY NOTES\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nAll-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold equivalent sold (\"AISC\"), sustaining capital expenditures, and non-sustaining capital expenditures are financial performance measures with no standard meaning under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the primary financial statements of the Company to which AISC relates is production costs and royalties. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the primary financial statements of the Company to which sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures relates is additions to property, plant, and equipment. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" section (the \"MD&#38;A Information\") in the Company's management's discussion and analysis (the \"MD&#38;A\") for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, dated November 5, 2024, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for further information with respect to AISC, sustaining capital expenditures, and non-sustaining capital expenditures and a detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial performance measures with the most directly comparable measure under IFRS. The MD&#38;A information is incorporated by reference into this press release.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding: the return to positive free cash flow mid-year; the planned four-week shutdown of the processing plant during the first quarter to carry out upgrades and tie-ins for the Media Luna Project; 2025 operational guidance including gold equivalent production, payable production by metal, AISC, sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustainable capital expenditures; the timeline for completion of the Media Luna Project; the Company becoming a meaningful copper producer with the metal representing approximately 20% of the guided 2025 production; increased gold equivalent production expectations in 2026 and holding at 450,000 to 500,000 oz AuEq through 2030 on the reserve case, with considerable exploration upside remaining; economies of scale and cost efficiencies expected to be attained as Media Luna ramps up; higher forecasted metal prices; expected improvements to AISC throughout the year and further improvements to costs in 2026 and 2027; planned investments in drilling, exploration, and EPO; use of funds from free cash flow; expected material decline of capital expenditures year-over-year with the completion of Media Luna in the first quarter; return of capital, including the previously-announced share buyback program likely to be complemented by a sustainable dividend that can grow over time; projected increases in copper and silver production; feed sources for the processing plant, stockpiling plans, pace of underground development, mining rate targets and expected mining methods; the potential for continued strength in underlying metal prices; assumptions regarding MXN/USD foreign exchange rate; expectations regarding corporate G&#38;A, reclamation and remediation costs; mid-year commencement of underground development off the Guajes Tunnel for EPO; the 2025 drilling and exploration forecast, including the primary focus of increasing resources and growing reserves from existing deposits with a greater portion of the overall budget focused on testing high-priority targets within the Media Luna Cluster as well as the broader Morelos Property; the five-year production outlook (2025 to 2029); the expected start-up of EPO in late 2026; pronounced cash flow seasonality in 2025 given lower first quarter production, working capital builds related to the sale of precious metal rich Cu concentrate, and increases to taxes and royalties paid in the first quarter resulting from higher expected profitability; sensitivities of key performance metrics to commodity prices and currency; and Torex's key strategic objectives to integrate and optimize the Morelos Property, deliver Media Luna to full production, grow reserves and resources, disciplined growth and capital allocation, retain and attract best industry talent, and build on ESG excellence. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"expects\", \"planned\", \"guided\", \"strategy\", \"target\", \"goal\", \"objective\", \"aim\" or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"will\", or \"is expected to\" occur. Forward-looking information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties identified in the Company's technical report (the \"Technical Report\") released on March 31, 2022, entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report ELG Mine Complex Life of Mine Plan and Media Luna Feasibility Study\", which has an effective date of March 16, 2022, Company's annual information form (\"AIF\") and management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&#38;A\") or other unknown but potentially significant impacts. Forward-looking information is based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analyses, and opinions of management made in light of its experience and perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, and other factors that management believes are relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date such statements are made. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.

Solely for purposes of this section, the Least Performing Index with\n\nrespect to each Review Date is the least performing of the Indices determined based on the closing level of each Index on that\n\nReview Date compared with its Initial Value.\n\nThe hypothetical payments set forth below assume the following:\n\n● an Initial Value for each Index of 100.00;\n\n● an Interest Barrier for each Index of 70.00 (equal to 70.00% of its hypothetical Initial Value);\n\n● a Trigger Value for each Index of 60.00 (equal to 60.00% of its hypothetical Initial Value); and\n\n● a Contingent Interest Rate of 6.00% per annum (payable at a rate of 0.50% per month).\n\nThe hypothetical Initial Value of each Index of 100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely\n\nactual Initial Value of any Index.\n\nThe actual Initial Value of each Index will be the closing level of that Index on the Pricing Date and will be provided in the pricing\n\nsupplement. For historical data regarding the actual closing levels of each Index, please see the historical information set forth under\n\n\"The Indices\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nEach hypothetical payment set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment applicable to a purchaser\n\nof the notes. The numbers appearing in the following examples have been rounded for ease of analysis.\n\nExample 1 - Notes are automatically called on the twelfth Review Date.\n\nDate\n\nClosing Level of Least\n\nPerforming Index\n\nPayment (per $1,000 principal amount note)\n\nFirst Review Date\n\n105.00\n\n$5.00\n\nSecond Review Date\n\n110.00\n\n$5.00\n\nThird through Eleventh\n\nReview Dates\n\nGreater than Initial Value\n\n$5.00\n\nTwelfth Review Date\n\n110.00\n\n$1,005.00\n\nTotal Payment\n\n$1,060.00 (6.00% return)\n\nBecause the closing level of each Index on the twelfth Review Date is greater than or equal to its Initial Value, the notes will be\n\nautomatically called for a cash payment, for each $1,000 principal amount note, of $1,005.00 (or $1,000 plus the Contingent Interest\n\nPayment applicable to the twelfth Review Date), payable on the applicable Call Settlement Date. The notes are not automatically\n\ncallable before the twelfth Review Date, even though the closing level of each Index on each of the first through eleventh Review Dates\n\nis greater than its Initial Value. When added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Review Dates, the\n\ntotal amount paid, for each $1,000 principal amount note, is $1,060.00. No further payments will be made on the notes.\n\nExample 2 - Notes have NOT been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is\n\ngreater than or equal to its Trigger Value and its Interest Barrier.\n\nDate\n\nClosing Level of Least\n\nPerforming Index\n\nPayment (per $1,000 principal amount note)\n\nFirst Review Date\n\n95.00\n\n$5.00\n\nSecond Review Date\n\n85.00\n\n$5.00\n\nThird through Fifty-Sixth\n\nReview Dates\n\nLess than Interest\n\nBarrier\n\n$0\n\nFinal Review Date\n\n90.00\n\n$1,005.00\n\nTotal Payment\n\n$1,015.00 (1.50% return)\n\nBecause the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is greater than or equal to its\n\nTrigger Value and its Interest Barrier, the payment at maturity, for each $1,000 principal amount note, will be $1,005.00 (or $1,000 plus\n\nthe Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the final Review Date). When added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with\n\nrespect to the prior Review Dates, the total amount paid, for each $1,000 principal amount note, is $1,015.00.\n\nPS-7| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\nExample 3 - Notes have NOT been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less\n\nthan its Interest Barrier but is greater than or equal to its Trigger Value.\n\nDate\n\nClosing Level of Least\n\nPerforming Index\n\nPayment (per $1,000 principal amount note)\n\nFirst Review Date\n\n80.00\n\n$5.00\n\nSecond Review Date\n\n75.00\n\n$5.00\n\nThird through Fifty-Sixth\n\nReview Dates\n\nLess than Interest\n\nBarrier\n\n$0\n\nFinal Review Date\n\n60.00\n\n$1,000.00\n\nTotal Payment\n\n$1,010.00 (1.00% return)\n\nBecause the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less than its Interest Barrier\n\nbut is greater than or equal to its Trigger Value, the payment at maturity, for each $1,000 principal amount note, will be $1,000.00.\n\nWhen added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Review Dates, the total amount paid, for each\n\n$1,000 principal amount note, is $1,010.00.\n\nExample 4 - Notes have NOT been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less\n\nthan its Trigger Value.\n\nDate\n\nClosing Level of Least\n\nPerforming Index\n\nPayment (per $1,000 principal amount note)\n\nFirst Review Date\n\n50.00\n\n$0\n\nSecond Review Date\n\n55.00\n\n$0\n\nThird through Fifty-Sixth\n\nReview Dates\n\nLess than Interest\n\nBarrier\n\n$0\n\nFinal Review Date\n\n50.00\n\n$500.00\n\nTotal Payment\n\n$500.00 (-50.00% return)\n\nBecause the notes have not been automatically called, the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less than its Trigger Value and\n\nthe Least Performing Index Return is -50.00%, the payment at maturity will be $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount note, calculated as\n\nfollows:\n\n$1,000 + [$1,000 × (-50.00%)] = $500.00\n\nThe hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term\n\nor until automatically called. These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the\n\nsecondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would\n\nlikely be lower.\n\nSelected Risk Considerations\n\nAn investment in the notes involves significant risks. These risks are explained in more detail in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of the\n\naccompanying prospectus supplement and product supplement and in Annex A to the accompanying prospectus addendum.\n\n● YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS -\n\nThe notes do not guarantee any return of principal. If the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of any Index\n\nis less than its Trigger Value, you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the Final Value of the Least\n\nPerforming Index is less than its Initial Value. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you will lose more than 40.00% of your\n\nprincipal amount at maturity and could lose all of your principal amount at maturity.\n\n● THE NOTES DO NOT GUARANTEE THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND MAY NOT PAY ANY INTEREST AT ALL -\n\nIf the notes have not been automatically called, we will make a Contingent Interest Payment with respect to a Review Date only if\n\nthe closing level of each Index on that Review Date is greater than or equal to its Interest Barrier. If the closing level of any Index\n\non that Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier, no Contingent Interest Payment will be made with respect to that Review Date.\n\nAccordingly, if the closing level of any Index on each Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier, you will not receive any interest\n\npayments over the term of the notes.\n\n● CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. -\n\nInvestors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential\n\nchange in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit\n\nrisk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment\n\nobligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.\n\nPS-8| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\n● AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS\n\n-\n\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of\n\nour securities and the collection of intercompany obligations. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase &\n\nCo., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to make payments under loans made by us to\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. or under other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from JPMorgan\n\nChase & Co. to meet our obligations under the notes. We are not a key operating subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and in a\n\nbankruptcy or resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. we are not expected to have sufficient resources to meet our obligations in\n\nrespect of the notes as they come due. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not make payments to us and we are unable to make\n\npayments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that\n\nguarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. For more\n\ninformation, see the accompanying prospectus addendum.\n\n● THE APPRECIATION POTENTIAL OF THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF ANY CONTINGENT INTEREST PAYMENTS\n\nTHAT MAY BE PAID OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES,\n\nregardless of any appreciation of any Index, which may be significant. You will not participate in any appreciation of any Index.\n\n● POTENTIAL CONFLICTS -\n\nWe and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase &\n\nCo.'s economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading\n\nactivities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the\n\nvalue of the notes declines. Please refer to \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\" in the accompanying product\n\nsupplement.\n\n● JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP THE S&P 500® INDEX,\n\nbut JPMorgan Chase & Co. will not have any obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate action that might affect\n\nthe level of the S&P 500® Index.\n\n● AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL CAPITALIZATION STOCKS WITH\n\nRESPECT TO THE RUSSELL 2000® INDEX -\n\nSmall capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative\n\nto larger companies. Small capitalization companies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks, and the presence of a dividend\n\npayment could be a factor that limits downward stock price pressure under adverse market conditions.\n\n● NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE NASDAQ-100® TECHNOLOGY SECTOR INDEXSM -\n\nThe non-U.S. equity securities included in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM have been issued by non-U.S. companies.\n\nInvestments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the home countries\n\nand/or the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. Also, with respect to equity\n\nsecurities that are not listed in the U.S., there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these\n\njurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC.\n\n● RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR WITH RESPECT TO THE NASDAQ-100® TECHNOLOGY SECTOR\n\nINDEXSM -\n\nAll or substantially all of the equity securities included in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM are issued by companies\n\nwhose primary line of business is directly associated with the technology sector. As a result, the value of the notes may be subject\n\nto greater volatility and be more adversely affected by a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting this sector\n\nthan a different investment linked to securities of a more broadly diversified group of issuers. The value of stocks of technology\n\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles,\n\nrapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition\n\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\n\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Technology\n\ncompanies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect\n\nprofitability. Additionally, companies in the technology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\n\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel. These factors could affect the technology sector and could affect the value\n\nof the equity securities included in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM and the level of the Nasdaq-100® Technology\n\nSector IndexSM during the term of the notes, which may adversely affect the value of your notes.\n\n● YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DECLINE IN THE LEVEL OF EACH INDEX-\n\nPayments on the notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Indices and are contingent upon the performance of each\n\nindividual Index. Poor performance by any of the Indices over the term of the notes may result in the notes not being automatically\n\ncalled on a Review Date, may negatively affect whether you will receive a Contingent Interest Payment on any Interest Payment\n\nDate and your payment at maturity and will not be offset or mitigated by positive performance by any other Index.\n\n● YOUR PAYMENT AT MATURITY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE LEAST PERFORMING INDEX.\n\n● THE BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THE TRIGGER VALUE MAY TERMINATE ON THE FINAL REVIEW DATE-\n\nIf the Final Value of any Index is less than its Trigger Value and the notes have not been automatically called, the benefit provided\n\nby the Trigger Value will terminate and you will be fully exposed to any depreciation of the Least Performing Index.\n\nPS-9| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\n● THE AUTOMATIC CALL FEATURE MAY FORCE A POTENTIAL EARLY EXIT -\n\nIf your notes are automatically called, the term of the notes may be reduced to as short as approximately one year and you will not\n\nreceive any Contingent Interest Payments after the applicable Call Settlement Date. There is no guarantee that you would be able\n\nto reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return and/or with a comparable interest rate for a similar\n\nlevel of risk. Even in cases where the notes are called before maturity, you are not entitled to any fees and commissions described\n\non the front cover of this pricing supplement.\n\n● YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON THE SECURITIES INCLUDED IN ANY INDEX OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH\n\nRESPECT TO THOSE SECURITIES.\n\n● THE RISK OF THE CLOSING LEVEL OF AN INDEX FALLING BELOW ITS INTEREST BARRIER OR TRIGGER VALUE IS\n\nGREATER IF THE LEVEL OF THAT INDEX IS VOLATILE.\n\n● LACK OF LIQUIDITY-\n\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely\n\nto depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes are not\n\ndesigned to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity.\n\n● THE FINAL TERMS AND VALUATION OF THE NOTES WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT -\n\nYou should consider your potential investment in the notes based on the minimums for the estimated value of the notes and the\n\nContingent Interest Rate.\n\n● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF\n\nTHE NOTES -\n\nThe estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the\n\nnotes will exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are\n\nincluded in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our\n\naffiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging\n\nour obligations under the notes. See \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\n● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER\n\nFROM OTHERS' ESTIMATES -\n\nSee \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\n● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE -\n\nThe internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding\n\nrate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may\n\nbe based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance,\n\noperational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income\n\ninstruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may\n\nprove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an\n\ninternal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any\n\nsecondary market prices of the notes. See \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\n● THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT\n\nSTATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME\n\nPERIOD -\n\nWe generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in\n\nconnection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period.\n\nSee \"Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period.\n\nAccordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by\n\nJPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).\n\n● SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE\n\nNOTES -\n\nAny secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other\n\nthings, secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and,\n\nalso, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging\n\ncosts that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy the\n\nnotes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to\n\nthe Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.\n\n● SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS -\n\nThe secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which\n\nmay either offset or magnify each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging\n\ncosts and the levels of the Indices. Additionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price\n\nfor the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the\n\nprice of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market. See \"Risk Factors -\n\nRisks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes - Secondary market prices of the notes will be\n\nimpacted by many economic and market factors\" in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nPS-10| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\nThe Indices\n\nThe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is an equal-weighted, price-return index designed to measure the performance of the\n\ntechnology companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index®.

In determining our reporting responsibilities we intend to treat (i) the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as\n\nprepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income, as\n\ndescribed in the section entitled \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences - Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders - Notes\n\nTreated as Prepaid Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons\" in the accompanying product supplement. Based on the\n\nadvice of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, our special tax counsel, we believe that this is a reasonable treatment, but that there are other\n\nreasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes\n\ncould be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal\n\nincome tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require\n\ninvestors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related\n\ntopics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the\n\nunderlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and\n\neffective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the\n\ntax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussions above and in the accompanying\n\nproduct supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the\n\nCode. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including\n\npossible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders - Tax Considerations. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain, and\n\nalthough we believe it is reasonable to take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to U.S. withholding tax (at\n\nleast if an applicable Form W-8 is provided), it is expected that withholding agents will (and we, if we are the withholding agent, intend\n\nto) withhold on any Contingent Interest Payment paid to a Non-U.S. Holder generally at a rate of 30% or at a reduced rate specified by\n\nan applicable income tax treaty under an \"other income\" or similar provision. We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with\n\nrespect to amounts withheld. In order to claim an exemption from, or a reduction in, the 30% withholding tax, a Non-U.S. Holder of the\n\nnotes must comply with certification requirements to establish that it is not a U.S. person and is eligible for such an exemption or\n\nreduction under an applicable tax treaty. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax treatment\n\nof the notes, including the possibility of obtaining a refund of any withholding tax and the certification requirement described above.\n\nSection 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (\"Section 871(m)\") generally impose a 30% withholding\n\ntax (unless an income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain\n\nfinancial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this\n\nwithholding regime, including for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable\n\nTreasury regulations. Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January\n\n1, 2027 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal\n\nincome tax purposes (each an \"Underlying Security\"). Based on certain determinations made by us, we expect that Section 871(m) will\n\nnot apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this\n\ndetermination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter\n\ninto other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of\n\nSection 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential\n\napplication of Section 871(m) to the notes.\n\nIn the event of any withholding on the notes, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes\n\nThe estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following\n\nhypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding\n\nrate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes\n\ndoes not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any\n\ntime. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding\n\nrate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be\n\nbased on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational\n\nand ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect,\n\nand is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and\n\nany potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes.\n\nFor additional information, see \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an\n\nInternal Funding Rate\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nPS-13| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\nThe value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our\n\naffiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various\n\nother inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as\n\nwell as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when\n\nthe terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others' estimates. Different pricing\n\nmodels and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In\n\naddition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On\n\nfuture dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at\n\nwhich JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling,\n\nstructuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid\n\nto JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks\n\ninherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because\n\nhedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that\n\nis more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the\n\nnotes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging\n\nprofits. See \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price to\n\nPublic) of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes\n\nFor information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the\n\nEstimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes - Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many\n\neconomic and market factors\" in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs\n\nincluded in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by\n\nJPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions,\n\nprojected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates\n\nfor structured debt issuances. This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the\n\nstated term of the notes. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a\n\nprofit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as\n\ndetermined by our affiliates. See \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be\n\nReflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time\n\nPeriod\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nSupplemental Use of Proceeds\n\nThe notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the\n\nnotes. See \"How the Notes Work\" and \"Hypothetical Payout Examples\" in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return\n\nprofile of the notes and \"The Indices\" in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.\n\nThe original issue price of the notes is equal to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other\n\naffiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent\n\nin hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.\n\nAdditional Terms Specific to the Notes\n\nYou may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable\n\nagent. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any\n\nchanges to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase.\n\nYou may also choose to reject such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.\n\nPS-14| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\nYou should read this pricing supplement together with the accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying\n\nprospectus supplement relating to our Series A medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, the accompanying prospectus\n\naddendum and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying\n\nsupplement.

Neither Nasdaq nor Nasdaq OMX has any obligation to continue to publish, and may\n\ndiscontinue publication of, the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM began on February 22, 2006 at a base value of 1,000.00. The Nasdaq-100® Technology\n\nSector IndexSM is reported by Bloomberg, L.P. under the ticker symbol \"NDXT.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is an equal-weighted, price-return index designed to measure the performance of the\n\ntechnology companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index®.\n\nSecurity Eligibility Criteria\n\nThe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM contains securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index® which are classified as Technology\n\naccording to the Industry Classification Benchmark (\"ICB\"). The eligibility for the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is\n\ndetermined in a 2-step process and the security has to meet both criteria in order to become eligible for the Nasdaq-100® Technology\n\nSector IndexSM.

Index Shares are calculated by dividing this equal-dollar market value for each Index Security by\n\nthe corresponding Last Sale Price of the security at the close of trading on the third Friday in March, June, September, and December.\n\nIn the case of multiple share classes of a company being included in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the equal-weighted\n\nmarket value will be divided equally among the securities of that company.\n\nIndex Calculation\n\nThe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is an equal weighted, price return index. The Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM\n\nis calculated without regard to ordinary dividends, however, it does reflect special dividends. The formula is as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\"Index Market Value\" shall be calculated as follows:\n\n\"Index Security\" shall mean a security that has been selected for membership in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM,\n\nhaving met all applicable eligibility requirements.\n\nn = Number of Index Securities included in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM\n\nqi = Number of shares of Index Security i applied in the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM.\n\npi = Price in quote currency of Index Security i.

The Index Divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in an Index Security's price or shares either by corporate\n\nactions or index participation which occur outside of trading hours do not affect the index value. An Index Divisor change occurs after\n\nthe close of the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM.\n\nIndex Maintenance\n\nDeletion Policy\n\nIf a component of the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is removed from the Nasdaq-100 Index® for any reason, it is also\n\nremoved from the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM at the same time.\n\nReplacement Policy\n\nWhen a component of the Nasdaq-100 Index® that is classified as Technology according to ICB is removed from the Nasdaq-100\n\nIndex, it is also removed from the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM. As such, if the replacement company being added to the\n\nNasdaq-100 Index® is classified as Technology according to ICB, it is added to the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM and will\n\nassume the weight of the removed company on the Index effective date.\n\nWhen a component of the Nasdaq-100 Index® that is not classified as Technology according to ICB is removed and the replacement\n\ncompany being added to the Nasdaq-100 Index is classified as Technology according to ICB, the replacement company is considered\n\nfor addition to the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM at the next quarterly Rebalance. When a component of the Nasdaq-100\n\nIndex that is classified as Technology according to ICB is removed from the Nasdaq-100 Index and the replacement company being\n\nadded to the Nasdaq-100 Index® is not classified as Technology according to ICB, the company is removed from the Nasdaq-100®\n\nTechnology Sector IndexSM and the divisor of the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM is adjusted to ensure Index continuity.\n\nAdditions Policy\n\nIf a security is added to the Nasdaq-100 Index® for any reason, it may be added to the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM at the\n\nsame time.\n\nCorporate Actions\n\nIn the interim periods between scheduled index reconstitution and rebalance events, individual Index securities may be the subject to a\n\nvariety of corporate actions and events that require maintenance and adjustments to the Index.\n\nIn certain cases, corporate actions and events are handled according to the weighting scheme or other index construction techniques\n\nemployed. Wherever alternate methods are described, the Index will follow the \"Non-Market Cap Corporate Action Method.\"\n\nIndex Share Adjustments\n\nOther than as a direct result of corporate actions, the Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM does not normally experience share\n\nadjustments between scheduled index rebalance and reconstitution events.\n\nLicense Agreement\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliate intends to enter into a non-exclusive license agreement with Nasdaq providing for the license to it\n\nand certain of its affiliates or subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Financial, with a non-exclusive license and, for a fee, with the right to use\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM in connection with certain securities, including the notes.\n\nThe license agreement with Nasdaq provides that the following language must be stated in this pricing supplement:\n\nPS-17| Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of\n\nthe Nasdaq-100® Technology Sector IndexSM, the Russell 2000® Index and\n\nthe S&P 500® Index\n\nThe notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Nasdaq Inc. or its affiliates (Nasdaq, with its affiliates, are referred to as\n\nthe \"Corporations\").

The actual Contingent Interest Rate will be provided in the pricing supplement and will be between 7.00% and 9.00% per annum.\n\nNumber of ContingentInterest Payments   Total Contingent InterestPayments \n6                                       $105.00 \n5                                       $87.50 \n4                                       $70.00 \n3                                       $52.50 \n2                                       $35.00 \n1                                       $17.50 \n0                                       $0.00 \n\n\nHypothetical Payout Examples\n\nThe following examples illustrate payments on the notes linked to three hypothetical Indices, assuming a range of performances for the hypothetical Least Performing Index on the Review Dates. Each hypothetical payment set forth below assumes that the closing level of each Index that is not the Least Performing Index on each Review Date is greater than or equal to its Initial Value (and therefore its Interest Barrier and Trigger Value).\n\nIn addition, the hypothetical payments set forth below assume the following:\n\n● an Initial Value for the Least Performing Index of 100.00; ● an Interest Barrier and a Trigger Value for the Least Performing Index of 70.00 (equal to 70.00% of its hypothetical Initial Value); and ● a Contingent Interest Rate of 7.00% per annum (payable at a rate of 1.75% per quarter).\n\nThe hypothetical Initial Value of the Least Performing Index of 100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Value of any Index.\n\nThe actual Initial Value of each Index will be the closing level of that Index on the Pricing Date and will be provided in the pricing supplement. For historical data regarding the actual closing levels of each Index, please see the historical information set forth under \"The Indices\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nEach hypothetical payment set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment applicable to a purchaser of the notes. The numbers appearing in the following examples have been rounded for ease of analysis.\n\nExample 1 - Notes are automatically called on the first Review Date.\n\nDate                Closing Level of LeastPerforming Index   Payment (per $1,000 principal amount note) \nFirst Review Date   105.00                                   $1,017.50 \n                    Total Payment                            $1,017.50 (1.75% return) \n\n\nBecause the closing level of each Index on the first Review Date is greater than or equal to its Initial Value, the notes will be automatically called for a cash payment, for each $1,000 principal amount note, of $1,017.50 (or $1,000 plus the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the first Review Date), payable on the applicable Call Settlement Date. No further payments will be made on the notes.\n\nPS-3 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\nExample 2 - Notes have NOT been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is greater than or equal to its Trigger Value.\n\nDate                               Closing Level of LeastPerforming Index   Payment (per $1,000 principal amount note) \nFirst Review Date                  95.00                                    $17.50 \nSecond Review Date                 85.00                                    $17.50 \nThird through Fifth Review Dates   Less than Interest Barrier               $0 \nFinal Review Date                  90.00                                    $1,017.50 \n                                   Total Payment                            $1,052.50 (5.25% return) \n\n\nBecause the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is greater than or equal to its Trigger Value, the payment at maturity, for each $1,000 principal amount note, will be $1,017.50 (or $1,000 plus the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the final Review Date). When added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Review Dates, the total amount paid, for each $1,000 principal amount note, is $1,052.50.\n\nExample 3 - Notes have NOT been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less than its Trigger Value.\n\nDate                               Closing Level of LeastPerforming Index   Payment (per $1,000 principal amount note) \nFirst Review Date                  60.00                                    $0 \nSecond Review Date                 65.00                                    $0 \nThird through Fifth Review Dates   Less than Interest Barrier               $0 \nFinal Review Date                  60.00                                    $600.00 \n                                   Total Payment                            $600.00 (-40.00% return) \n\n\nBecause the notes have not been automatically called, the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less than its Trigger Value and the Least Performing Index Return is -40.00%, the payment at maturity will be $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount note, calculated as follows:\n\n$1,000 + [$1,000 × (-40.00%)] = $600.00\n\nThe hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term or until automatically called. These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower.\n\nSelected Risk Considerations\n\nAn investment in the notes involves significant risks. These risks are explained in more detail in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and product supplement.\n\n● YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS -\n\nThe notes do not guarantee any return of principal. If the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of any Index is less than its Trigger Value, you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the Final Value of the Least Performing Index is less than its Initial Value. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you will lose more than 30.00% of your principal amount at maturity and could lose all of your principal amount at maturity. ● THE NOTES DO NOT GUARANTEE THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND MAY NOT PAY ANY INTEREST AT ALL -\n\nIf the notes have not been automatically called, we will make a Contingent Interest Payment with respect to a Review Date only if the closing level of each Index on that Review Date is greater than or equal to its Interest Barrier. If the closing level of any Index on that Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier, no Contingent Interest Payment will be made with respect to that Review Date. Accordingly, if the closing level of any Index on each Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier, you will not receive any interest payments over the term of the notes. ● CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. -\n\nInvestors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.\n\nPS-4 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\n● AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS -\n\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ● THE APPRECIATION POTENTIAL OF THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF ANY CONTINGENT INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE PAID OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES,\n\nregardless of any appreciation of any Index, which may be significant. You will not participate in any appreciation of any Index. ● POTENTIAL CONFLICTS -\n\nWe and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. Please refer to \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\" in the accompanying product supplement. ● JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP THE S&P 500® INDEX,\n\nbut JPMorgan Chase & Co. will not have any obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate action that might affect the level of the S&P 500® Index. ● AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL CAPITALIZATION STOCKS WITH RESPECT TO THE RUSSELL 2000® INDEX -\n\nSmall capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small capitalization companies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks, and the presence of a dividend payment could be a factor that limits downward stock price pressure under adverse market conditions. ● NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE NASDAQ-100 INDEX® -\n\nThe non-U.S. equity securities included in the NASDAQ-100 Index® have been issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the home countries and/or the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. Also, with respect to equity securities that are not listed in the U.S., there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. ● YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DECLINE IN THE LEVEL OF EACH INDEX-\n\nPayments on the notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Indices and are contingent upon the performance of each individual Index. Poor performance by any of the Indices over the term of the notes may result in the notes not being automatically called on a Review Date, may negatively affect whether you will receive a Contingent Interest Payment on any Interest Payment Date and your payment at maturity and will not be offset or mitigated by positive performance by any other Index. ● YOUR PAYMENT AT MATURITY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE LEAST PERFORMING INDEX. ● THE BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THE TRIGGER VALUE MAY TERMINATE ON THE FINAL REVIEW DATE-\n\nIf the Final Value of any Index is less than its Trigger Value and the notes have not been automatically called, the benefit provided by the Trigger Value will terminate and you will be fully exposed to any depreciation of the Least Performing Index. ● THE AUTOMATIC CALL FEATURE MAY FORCE A POTENTIAL EARLY EXIT -\n\nIf your notes are automatically called, the term of the notes may be reduced to as short as approximately three months and you will not receive any Contingent Interest Payments after the applicable Call Settlement Date. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return and/or with a comparable interest rate for a similar level of risk. Even in cases where the notes are called before maturity, you are not entitled to any fees and commissions described on the front cover of this pricing supplement. ● YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON THE SECURITIES INCLUDED IN ANY INDEX OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THOSE SECURITIES. ● THE RISK OF THE CLOSING LEVEL OF AN INDEX FALLING BELOW ITS INTEREST BARRIER OR TRIGGER VALUE IS GREATER IF THE LEVEL OF THAT INDEX IS VOLATILE. ● LACK OF LIQUIDITY-\n\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity. ● THE FINAL TERMS AND VALUATION OF THE NOTES WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT -\n\nYou should consider your potential investment in the notes based on the minimums for the estimated value of the notes and the Contingent Interest Rate.\n\nPS-5 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\n● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF THE NOTES -\n\nThe estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes will exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement. ● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER FROM OTHERS' ESTIMATES -\n\nSee \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement. ● THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE -\n\nThe internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See \"The Estimated Value of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement. ● THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD -\n\nWe generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. See \"Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements). ● SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE NOTES -\n\nAny secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS -\n\nThe secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the levels of the Indices. Additionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market. See \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes - Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors\" in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nThe Indices\n\nThe NASDAQ-100 Index® is a modified market capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest non-financial securities listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market based on market capitalization. For additional information about the NASDAQ-100 Index®, see \"Equity Index Descriptions - The NASDAQ-100 Index®\" in the accompanying underlying supplement.\n\nThe Russell 2000® Index consists of the middle 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000ETM Index and, as a result of the index calculation methodology, consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000® Index. The Russell 2000® Index is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. For additional information about the Russell 2000® Index, see \"Equity Index Descriptions - The Russell Indices\" in the accompanying underlying supplement.\n\nThe S&P 500® Index consists of stocks of 500 companies selected to provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets. For additional information about the S&P 500® Index, see \"Equity Index Descriptions - The S&P U.S. Indices\" in the accompanying underlying supplement.\n\nPS-6 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\nHistorical Information\n\nThe following graphs set forth the historical performance of each Index based on the weekly historical closing levels from January 4, 2019 through May 10, 2024. The closing level of the NASDAQ-100 Index® on May 14, 2024 was 18,322.77. The closing level of the Russell 2000® Index on May 14, 2024 was 2,085.694. The closing level of the S&P 500® Index on May 14, 2024 was 5,246.68. We obtained the closing levels above and below from the Bloomberg Professional® service (\"Bloomberg\"), without independent verification.\n\nThe historical closing levels of each Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the closing level of any Index on the Pricing Date or any Review Date. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Indices will result in the return of any of your principal amount or the payment of any interest.\n\nHistorical Performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index®\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nHistorical Performance of the Russell 2000® Index\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nPS-7 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\nHistorical Performance of the S&P 500® Index\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nTax Treatment\n\nYou should review carefully the section entitled \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\" in the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I. In determining our reporting responsibilities we intend to treat (i) the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences - Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders - Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons\" in the accompanying product supplement. Based on the advice of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, our special tax counsel, we believe that this is a reasonable treatment, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussions above and in the accompanying product supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders - Tax Considerations. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain, and although we believe it is reasonable to take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to U.S. withholding tax (at least if an applicable Form W-8 is provided), it is expected that withholding agents will (and we, if we are the withholding agent, intend to) withhold on any Contingent Interest Payment paid to a Non-U.S. Holder generally at a rate of 30% or at a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty under an \"other income\" or similar provision. We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. In order to claim an exemption from, or a reduction in, the 30% withholding tax, a Non-U.S. Holder of the notes must comply with certification requirements to establish that it is not a U.S. person and is eligible for such an exemption or reduction under an applicable tax treaty. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax treatment of the notes, including the possibility of obtaining a refund of any withholding tax and the certification requirement described above.\n\nPS-8 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\nSection 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (\"Section 871(m)\") generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless an income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime, including for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an \"Underlying Security\"). Based on certain determinations made by us, we expect that Section 871(m) will not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.\n\nIn the event of any withholding on the notes, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes\n\nThe estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. For additional information, see \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nThe value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others' estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.\n\nThe estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits. See \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price to Public) of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nPS-9 | Structured Investments\n\nAuto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the NASDAQ-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index\n\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes\n\nFor information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes - Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors\" in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances. This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See \"Selected Risk Considerations - The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nSupplemental Use of Proceeds\n\nThe notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See \"How the Notes Work\" and \"Hypothetical Payout Examples\" in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and \"The Indices\" in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.\n\nThe original issue price of the notes is equal to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.\n\nAdditional Terms Specific to the Notes\n\nYou may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable agent. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.\n\nYou should read this pricing supplement together with the accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying prospectus supplement relating to our Series A medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement.

         "The difficulty of buying a house nowadays is one of the most worrying problems in Spain. The rise in prices and the legal insecurity latent today in terms of housing makes acquiring a property a real odyssey.\n\nThis rise in prices has to do with the shortage of supply and the large existing demand. Therefore, according to the Spanish Youth Council (CJE), the average age at which young people emancipate in our country is 30.3 years. In this sense, Spanish young people are among those who take the longest to leave home in the entire European Union. According to Statista, only Croatia and Greece are ahead of Spain.",

         "However, the difficulties depend on the Autonomous Community in which you are looking for a job. It is normal to think that cities like Madrid or Barcelona are among the most complex areas to acquire a property in conditions. And although it is true, there is a provincial capital that is positioned ahead of these two cities, being the place in Spain where it is more complex to buy a house due to its high cost.\n\nThe most expensive provincial capitals\n\nAccording to the latest , the price of housing has increased year-on-year in March 2025 compared to the same period of the previous year. In this sense, Donostia-San Sebastián continues to be the most expensive capital with 6,712 €/m², followed by Madrid capital (5,853 €/m²) and Barcelona capital (5,010 €/m²). Also noteworthy are Palma de Mallorca with 4,971 €/m² and Malaga city with 3,941 €/m².\n\nFor their part, the most expensive Autonomous Communities in this March 2025 are the Balearic Islands, Madrid and the Basque Country, where the price per square meter stands at 4,970 euros in the Balearic Islands, 4,550 euros in Madrid and 3,404 euros in the Basque Country.\n\nBuying a house with a squatter is up to 60% cheaper\n\nAlthough there is not a , Idealista has registered more than 20,000 throughout Spain in its database, according to a recent analysis published by the real estate marketplace, although some sources speak of squatted properties may exceed 100,000 units. And each case for sale, as far as its rightful owner is concerned, is different: families who need the money that can give them that home, others who want to get rid of the problem or banks and investment funds who also want to get rid of assets that bring them \"more expenses than profitability,\" as Aurrecochea explains.\n\nHowever, when a citizen acquires a property with a squatter, he knows that he is obtaining the ownership of the property but not its possession. For this reason, the costs of releasing a property due to this type of problem amount to up to 4,000 euros, in addition to having to deal with the whole process, which usually takes between two and three years.\n\nFaced with this inconvenience, the discounts at which these homes are purchased can reach up to 60%, according to Aurrecoechea.\n\nRents remain high\n\nIn case of not being able to buy a house, one of the options most chosen by citizens is to enter into a rental. However, this alternative, since the price of rent continues to soar.\n\nRents soared by 10.3% during the last twelve months, according to a report published by idealista that analyzes the prices of the first quarter of the year. In quarterly rate, the price grew by 3.5%. At the end of March 2025, renting a home in our country had a cost of 14 euros per square meter.\n\nAll the capitals now have higher rental prices than in March 2024, except Lérida, where they have fallen by 1%. Teruel is the capital where rent has grown the most in one year, by 18.8%. It is followed by Castellón de la Plana (16%), Santa Cruz de Tenerife (14.2%), Ávila (14.2%) and Lugo (14%).\n\nThe problem of abusive housing prices\n\n3,000 euros for a property of barely 30 square meters. that can be seen in some advertising platforms. The owners try to modernize and make up the housing, ensuring that it is a comfortable and cozy space, with the aim of being able to inflate the price.\n\nSmall studios in the center of Madrid that, due to its location, its price is totally incomprehensible, even more so considering the available living space. Any excuse is a good one to raise the price. \"Ingenious idea\", \"cozy apartment\" and \"stylish house\" are some of the descriptions that can be found in this type of apartments.",

         "Moreover, it is also expanding its play in the food market by entering into cold chain-based food products such as 'idli' batter and also entering into regional delicacies.\n\nWhen asked about the IPO, Sharma said: \"It is too early for us. The board had done a pre-IPO study and based on that it asked us to explore and evaluate accessing capital markets in India.\"\n\nThis happened in late June and July, when there is summer holidays, as far as Europe is concerned.\n\n\"So this is some work that we will start to do now. As indicated in the statement given by the board, if at all we were to take a decision to do something, is to be expected it will only be by 2025,\" said Sharma on the sidelines of World Food India Summit organised by Ficci here.\n\nIn 2007, the Norwegian industrial investment company Orkla ASA acquired MTR Foods, a packaged foods company based in Bengaluru, India, for USD 80 million.\n\nThe company has a revenue of around Rs 2,300 crore in which its MTR brand contributes 48 per cent while 34 per cent comes from Eastern and the remaining from the international market. The company has achieved around 12-13 per cent growth.\n\nOrkla India also expects good growth coming during the festive season, which has already started from the South with the Onam festival. It is encouraged with a \"good run\" from its Kerala markets.\n\n\"The current year has been a little bit of a challenging year thanks to the consumption drop that we had, coupled with the very high level of food inflation...But we do see that food inflation is starting to slow down. Last quarter, the consumption jumped up from 4 per cent to 7 per cent but we have not yet seen the impact of that in the market. So we are hoping that, you know, we will have a very good festival season,\" Sharma said.\n\nThe company will be focusing on selling its gulab jamuns and the ready-to-eat sweets portfolio that it has just launched in the market.\n\n\"MTR is a food company and it needs to continue to develop and expand that into other food categories, for example in the sweet category, we were only in the mixes portfolio, so we wanted to expand our footprint into the ready-to-eat sweets portfolio. We have come out with a whole range of sweets from Karnataka,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, as the market for cold chain-based food products is picking up with a rise in discretionary income, where people want to consume fresh food, it has entered into idli and dosa batter and also launched 'Malabar Parota'.\n\nBesides, the company which acquired Eastern brand in 2021, aims to upgrade it into a food company.\n\n\"Presently, 90 per cent of the portfolio comes out of spices and condiments\" and the company aims to evolve Eastern to make it a food company, he said.\n\nOn its international presence, Sharma said its products are available in about 42 markets across the world.\n\n\"We are now focusing on nine markets where we are going to focus and going to build this business over there out,\" he said, adding that in its international market, MTR focuses on South Indian diaspora, while Eastern is into Malayali diaspora and Rasoi Magic is targeting Punjabi and Gujarati diasporas.\n\nHe further added: \"Exports roughly contribute 18 per cent of our total business. But given the higher growth trajectory of exports, I think it's expected to become roughly 20 per cent of our business.\"",

         "* Following discussions between TMC subsidiary Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI) and its sponsoring state, the Republic of Nauru, NORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for the expected submission of its ISA exploitation application\n\n* Given it is unlikely the ISA would consider an application prior to its March 2025 session, the Republic of Nauru has requested in a formal letter that the ISA clarify the submission and review process during the March session, with the goal of providing certainty for all stakeholders and allowing for review to begin immediately after NORI’s submission under an agreed-upon process\n\n* Following the expected submission of NORI’s application, the Company expects quarterly cash use of less than $5 million as the application is reviewed, and does not expect to raise funds for capital expenditures relating to the preparation of the Hidden Gem vessel for commercial production until increased regulatory certainty is achieved or non-dilutive financing is secured\n\n* The Company has begun to explore a new strategy to (1) develop a services business for seafloor resource development and (2) optimize and diversify its resource portfolio within international waters and in certain national jurisdictions Gerard Barron, TMC Chairman and CEO, commented: “After many years of conversations with current and prospective shareholders, it remains clear that the key catalyst everyone is waiting for is the delivery of the Mining Code. Following discussions with Member States and the incoming ISA Secretary-General during the UN General Assembly in September, I remain confident that the work on the Mining Code remains on track. These discussions have also informed the decision to submit the NORI application in June 2025, in consultation with Nauru. Investors can be assured that we will not be raising funds for CAPEX related to the Hidden Gem vessel until we see sufficient regulatory progress, whether through delivery of the Mining Code or additional clarity on the ISA’s review of our application based on the draft regulations.\n\nBut TMC’s value proposition extends beyond a narrow focus on the Mining Code and NORI application. We are now in a strong position to leverage our investment of over half a billion dollars and capabilities developed over the last decade-plus, as the eyes of the world’s largest economies turn to the seafloor to produce the metals needed for the energy transition, defense, infrastructure and the needs of a growing world population. I look forward to providing further color on this strategy.”\n\nApplication Submission and Strategy\n\nNORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for its expected submission of its ISA exploitation application. According to the ISA Council's decisions ISBA/28/C/24 and ISBA/28/C/25, if NORI submits an application for a plan of work for exploitation before the RRPs have been adopted, the ISA Council at its next meeting, as a matter of priority, will consider the process for considering such an application. The ISA Council is not scheduled to meet again until March 2025 and the Company believes it is unlikely that the ISA Council would consider an application for a plan of work for exploitation before this session. In light of this, Nauru has formally requested that the ISA clarify the submission and review process for such an application at the March 2025 meetings before NORI submits the Application and, therefore, has decided to submit the Application after the March 2025 meetings on June 27, 2025.\n\nISA Progress on the Mining Code\n\nThe ISA Council completed a first reading of the consolidated text of the draft Mining Code at the July 2024 Council meeting. It was agreed that a revised consolidated text of the draft Mining Code would be provided to the ISA Council by the end of November 2024. The Company has engaged with Leticia Reis de Carvalho, the newly-elected Secretary General of the ISA, and expects to work with Ms. Carvalho in a constructive manner as the ISA continues to work to have the final Mining Code adopted.\n\nOperating Expense Reductions and Deferral of Capital Expenditures\n\nFollowing the expected submission of the Application by NORI, the Company expects quarterly cash use of less than $5 million as the Application is reviewed. The Company has already begun the process of reducing or eliminating certain operating expenses to ensure the Company’s financial resiliency.\n\nFurther, the Company does not expect to raise funds for capital expenditures related to the preparation of the Hidden Gem vessel for commercial production until such time as the final Mining Code is adopted, the Application is approved, or until other potential non-dilutive strategic financing is in place. The Company expects to provide further updates on the potential timing of the start of commercial production following sufficient clarity on these items.\n\nExpanded Company Strategy\n\nGiven the significant rise in seafloor resource exploration opportunities around the globe and the Company’s leadership position and experience in this industry, having invested over $500 million since inception to achieve milestones in environmental research, resource definition, test mining and test processing, the Company is exploring a new strategy to (1) develop a services business for seafloor resource development and (2) optimize and diversify its resource portfolio within international waters and in national jurisdictions. We are in discussions with several parties on services contracts to provide our expertise in the areas of new exploration plans of work, resource definition, environmental impact assessments, data management and offshore campaign execution. We are also actively evaluating opportunities for the Company to enter new exploration contract areas, already permitted properties and producing properties.\n\nAbout The Metals Company\n\nThe Metals Company is an explorer of lower-impact battery metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, on a dual mission: (1) supply metals for the global energy transition with the least possible negative impacts on planet and people and (2) trace, recover and recycle the metals we supply to help create a metal commons that can be used in perpetuity. The Company through its subsidiaries holds exploration and commercial rights to three polymetallic nodule contract areas in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean regulated by the International Seabed Authority and sponsored by the governments of Nauru, Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga.

Capri's 'BB' rating and Negative Outlook reflect ongoing top-line and EBITDA declines in its portfolio. In addition, the Negative Outlook indicates potential for EBITDAR leverage to be sustained above 3.0x and EBITDAR fixed charge coverage to be sustained below 2.0x over the next 12 to 24 months as Capri works to stabilize portfolio performance while facing weak consumer spending and uncertainty around tariffs.",

         "To support the 'BB' rating, Capri needs to stabilize operations, expanding the top line and EBITDA meaningfully from an expected $315 million in fiscal 2026, in addition to repaying debt over the next 12 to 24 months. Fitch notes that proceeds from the recently announced Versace sale could aid in deleveraging in the near term and help offset potential negative impacts if consumer spending weakens further.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nProposed Versace Sale: On April 10, 2025, Capri announced that it is selling Versace for $1.375 billion to Prada S.p.A. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2025 and Fitch expects Capri to deploy, at minimum, $700 million of the proceeds toward debt reduction, as stipulated by the terms of the credit agreement. Versace generated approximately $880 million and $10 million in revenue and EBITDA, respectively, for the LTM period ending Dec. 28, 2024. At its peak in fiscal 2022, Versace generated approximately $1.1 billion in revenue and $235 million in EBITDA.\n\nAssuming $700 million in debt reduction, Fitch expects the transaction could provide an approximate 0.9x deleveraging opportunity in fiscal 2026. The sale of Versace will decrease the overall brand, geographic, and product profile diversification of the portfolio, with Versace being more heavily skewed toward apparel, Asia, and men's products relative to Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. However, Fitch acknowledges that post the sale, Capri will have more time to focus on its repositioning efforts at Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.\n\nOngoing Top-Line and EBITDA Declines: Fitch expects EBITDA, pro forma for the Versace sale, to decline to $315 million in fiscal 2026 (ending March 2026) from an estimated $360 million in fiscal 2025, driven by a low-double-digit top-line decline at Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. This compares to proforma EBITDA of approximately $700 million in fiscal 2024 and a peak $1.1 billion in fiscal 2022. Capri has underperformed since early 2023, partly due to brand-specific issues at Michael Kors, exacerbated by management missteps and underinvestment during the merger process.\n\nFitch expects near-term results will also be impacted by declines in consumer sentiment, business disruption, and rising costs from evolving U.S. tariff policies. Discretionary categories could see revenue down as much as mid-single digits with outsized EBITDA declines due to tariff-related cost pressure. Fitch expects Capri's fiscal 2026 top-line results could be weaker due to the company's ongoing portfolio repositioning efforts.\n\nElevated Execution Risk: Capri shared medium-term growth targets for its portfolio in February 2025, identifying fiscal 2026 as a reset year. Beginning in fiscal 2027, management expects revenue to grow in the mid-to-high-single-digit range, driven by high-single-digit growth at Michael Kors and mid-single-digit growth at Jimmy Choo. Fitch expects Capri could require 12 to 24 months to stabilize its business, with Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo returning to low-single-digit and mid-single-digit top-line growth, respectively, in fiscal 2027. This assumes that Capri corrects its pricing strategy, addresses product offerings and stabilizes wholesale. Fitch views execution risk as high.\n\nEBITDA Below Historical Levels: Fitch expects Capri's EBITDA, pro forma for the Versace sale, to expand from an estimated $360 million in fiscal 2025 to approximately $465 million by fiscal 2028, meaningfully below the $960 million to $1.1 billion range seen in fiscal 2022 and 2023. This assumes stabilization of top-line trends in fiscal 2027 and EBITDA margin expansion from an expected 8.0% in fiscal 2025 to the low double digits. Capri must balance investments with cost efficiencies to achieve this expansion.\n\nReasonable FCF: Due to EBITDA declines, Fitch expects free cash flow (FCF) to trend in the $80 million to $200 million range beginning in fiscal 2025. This is compared to an average of around $450 million over the last four years. Historically, Capri has used cash generation for debt repayment, share repurchases and business investment. After the merger was terminated, the company announced that its capital allocation priorities will be investing in the business, repaying debt and returning cash to shareholders.\n\nModerate Leverage, Weak Coverage: Fitch expects Capri's EBITDAR leverage to climb to the mid-3x range in fiscal 2025, from 2.6x in fiscal 2024, driven by EBITDA declines. EBITDAR leverage could return to 3.0x in fiscal 2026, aided by deleveraging proceeds from the Versace sale. To support a 'BB' rating, Capri needs to bring EBITDAR leverage back below 3.0x. The 3.0x EBITDAR leverage threshold is low for a 'BB' rating and is balanced by the company's weak EBITDAR fixed charge coverage. This is expected to be in the mid-1x range in fiscal 2025 and could return to 2.0x over the next 24 months, in line with EBITDA expansion.\n\nParent-Subsidiary Linkage: Fitch's analysis includes a strong subsidiary/weak parent approach between the parent, Capri, and its subsidiaries, Michael Kors (USA) Inc. and Michael Kors (Switzerland) GmbH. Fitch assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high, which results in an equalization of their IDRs.\n\nPeer Analysis\n\nSimilarly rated peers include Signet Jewelers Ltd. (Signet; BB+/Stable), Samsonite Group S.A. (Samsonite; BB+/Stable) and Levi Strauss & Co. (Levi; BBB-/Stable). Signet and Samsonite remain Under Criteria Observation (UCO) given their new treatment of leases, as detailed in Fitch's RAC published on Dec. 12, 2024. The UCO designation indicates that the existing ratings may change due to the application of the final criteria.\n\nSignet's ratings consider good execution from a top-line and margin standpoint, which supports Fitch's longer-term expectations of low-single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth. The rating reflects Signet's leading market position as a U.S. specialty jeweler with an approximately 9% share of a highly fragmented industry.\n\nSamsonite's rating considers the company's status as the world's largest travel luggage company, with strong brands and historically good organic growth.\n\nLevi's ratings reflect its position as one of the world's largest branded apparel manufacturers, with broad channel and geographic exposure, and good execution in terms of both the top line and margins. This supports Fitch's medium-term expectations of low-single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nThe below assumptions are pro forma for the Versace sale.\n\n--Fitch expects that revenue declined in the mid-teens to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2025 (ended March 2025), driven by double-digit declines at Michael Kors and Versace. Fitch expects organic revenue to decline in the low double digits in fiscal 2026, as the company works through its ongoing portfolio repositioning efforts compounded by ongoing softness in consumer spending for discretionary goods driven in part by the inflationary impact from recent tariffs;\n\n--Fitch's base case assumes that fiscal 2026 revenue declines to $3.2 billion, accounting for the sale of Versace, which is expected to generate approximately $825 million in revenue in fiscal 2025;\n\n--Beginning in fiscal 2027, revenue growth could turn flat to slightly positive, driven by low-single-digit growth at Michael Kors and low-to-mid-single-digit growth at Jimmy Choo;\n\n--EBITDA to contract to approximately $360 million in fiscal 2025, from $780 million in fiscal 2024, driven by top-line declines and gross margin contraction. EBITDA could decline further in fiscal 2026, to $315 million, driven by top-line deleveraging, which is partially offset by the company's ongoing cost savings initiatives and tightened inventory management. Fitch projects that Versace will generate flat to slightly negative EBITDA in fiscal 2025;\n\n--FCF to be around $100 million in fiscal 2025 assuming a modest working capital inflow and capital expenditures around $125 million. Beginning in fiscal 2026, FCF could trend in the $100 million to $200 million range, assuming an EBITDA rebound, and annual capital expenditure (capex) averaging around $175 million. Fitch expects Capri to deploy FCF toward debt reduction, in line with its historical practice;\n\n--EBITDAR leverage to climb to the mid-3x range in fiscal 2025, from 2.6x in fiscal 2024, driven by significant EBITDA declines. Fitch expects EBITDAR leverage to moderate to below 3x by fiscal 2027, driven by EBITDA expansion and debt repayment. At minimum, Fitch expects that Capri will deploy $700 million from the Versace proceeds toward debt reduction;\n\n--Interest rate assumptions: The revolving credit facility (SOFR+2.00%) and term loan facility (SOFR+2.00%) are both floating rate instruments. Fitch's annual SOFR assumptions are as follows: fiscal 2025 4.75%, fiscal 2026 4.00%, fiscal 2027 4.0%, and fiscal 2028 4.0%;\n\n--Achieving the above assumptions could result in a revision of Capri's Outlook to Stable.\n\nRecovery Analysis\n\nFitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers that are assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. Due to the distance to default, Recovery Ratings in the 'BB' category are not computed by bespoke analysis. Instead, they serve as a label to reflect an estimate of the risk of these instruments relative to other instruments in the entity's capital structure.\n\nFitch affirmed Capri Holdings Limited's, Michael Kors (Switzerland) GmbH's and Michael Kors (USA), Inc.'s (co-borrowers) secured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'/'RR1'. In addition, Fitch affirmed the secured term loan facility at 'BBB-'/'RR1'. The credit facilities are secured by certain U.S. assets and intellectual property.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n-- A slower than expected top-line and EBITDA recovery;\n\n-- EBITDAR leverage sustained above 3.0x;\n\n-- EBITDAR fixed charge coverage sustained below 2.0x.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nFitch could revise the Outlook to Stable if EBITDAR leverage is sustained below 3.0x and EBITDAR fixed charge coverage is around 2.0x. This could be accomplished through a combination of an EBITDA rebound and debt repayment. In addition, Fitch would need increased confidence in the company's ability to stabilize operations, as evidenced through revenue and EBITDA expansion beginning in fiscal 2027.\n\nAn upgrade to 'BB+' could result from the following:\n\n-- Low-single-digit growth, along with EBITDA expansion and debt repayment;\n\n-- EBITDAR leverage sustained below 2.5x;\n\n-- EBITDAR fixed charge coverage approaching the high-2x range.\n\nLiquidity and Debt Structure\n\nAs of Dec. 28, 2024, Capri had $356 million in cash and $978 million in availability on its revolving credit facility. The company's debt structure as of Dec. 28, 2024, consisted of its $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due July 2027, $450 million in unsecured term loan debt maturing Oct. 31, 2025, and a EUR450 million term loan facility borrowed under Gianni Versace S.r.l., which matures in December 2025.\n\nIn February 2025, Capri amended its credit agreement. As part of this amendment, Capri secured its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and entered a new $700 million secured term loan. The credit facilities are secured by certain U.S. assets and intellectual property.\n\nThe revolving facility is co-borrowed by Capri Holdings, Michael Kors (USA), Inc. and Michael Kors (Switzerland) GmbH. The term loan is co-borrowed by Michael Kors (USA) Inc. for the USD tranche, and Michael Kors (Switzerland) GmbH for the Euro tranche.\n\nIssuer Profile\n\nCapri Holdings Limited is a leading global manufacturer and retailer of accessories and leather goods, primarily handbags and footwear. Pro forma for the Versace sale, Capri's portfolio consists of two brands: Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\nHistorical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock-based compensation and exclude non-recurring charges. Fitch uses the balance sheet reported lease liability as the capitalized lease value when computing lease-equivalent debt.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nMACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND SECTOR FORECASTS\n\nClick here: https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research?keyword=Corporates%20Macro%20%26%20Sector%20Forecasts\n\nto access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.\n\nThe information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.\n\nFor Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001\n\nFitch Ratings, Inc. is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the “NRSRO”). While certain of the NRSRO’s credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see\n\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory: https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory\n\n), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the “non-NRSROs”) and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.",

         "Through Tuesday, the S&P 500 SPX had returned 0.5% for 2025 with dividends reinvested. That was quite a recovery, considering the large-cap U.S. benchmark stock index had been down 15% through April 8. How did you feel when the market was near its bottom last month?\n\nThis is an important question for investors to address right now. In hindsight, we know that the best thing for an investor in an S&P 500 index fund to do after the decline that followed President Donald Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff announcements on April 2 was nothing.\n\nBut if you had regrets at the bottom on April 8, and wished your investment portfolio was less highly concentrated in the largest U.S. stocks, the market's recovery might make it easier for you to start altering the mix. Paul Merriman recently explained that investment-portfolio performance over the long haul depended on the allocation to stocks and bonds. His work, incorporating data going back to 1970, might help you to find a balance between risk and performance potential, which can make it easier for you to tolerate sharp market declines.\n\nAnd now let's get back to the income objective. Many investors prefer to have money flowing in continually.\n\nIt turns out that for long-term investors, high-yield bond indexes have performed much better than indexes of investment-grade bonds. For taxable bonds, we covered this phenomenon in this article featuring an interview with John McClain, who co-manages BrandywineGlobal High Yield Fund BGHAX BGHIX and the BrandywineGlobal Corporate Credit Fund BCAAX BCGIX.\n\nDefinitions\n\nBefore discussing tax-exempt bonds, we need to review some terminology:\n\n* Bond: A bond is a debt security. A company or government entity issues bonds to borrow money. The issuer pays interest to the bondholders until the bond matures. Interest is typically paid every six months. On the maturity date, the issuer will redeem the bonds at face value, or possibly a different value depending on the features of the bond. Bondholders are free to sell their bonds at any time to other investors, but the market value when selling will depend on market conditions.\n\n* High-yield bond: A bond that is considered to be below investment-grade because it has a low credit rating or because the issuer chose not to pay one of the ratings firms to rate its bonds. The two largest credit-rating firms are S&P Global and Moody's Ratings. At S&P, a bond is considered investment grade if it is rated BBB- or higher. At Moody's, the minimum investment-grade rating is Baa3. You can review S&P's ratings hierarchy here and Moody's rating scale here. Fidelity lines up the agencies' ratings next to each other here.\n\n* Default: Failure of a bond issuer to make interest payments or to repay principal. Following a default, a bond investor may or may not recover a percentage of their investment as the issuer goes through bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n* Municipal Bond: A bond issued by a state or local government in the U.S. Interest on these bonds is typically exempt from federal income taxes and from state and local income taxes for residents of the state in which the bond was issued. But not all municipal bonds are tax-exempt.\n\n* Price: This is a bond's price relative to its face value. If a bond is trading at its face value, we say it is trading at 100, or par. If it is trading at 1% above or below its face value, we say it is trading at 101 or 99, respectively. Municipal bonds might be issued at a premium or discount to the face value. And when they are redeemed or called, the price paid by the issuer may be a premium or discount to par. All of that is spelled out by the underwriter when a bond is issued.\n\n* Inverse relationship: As bond prices move up and down, bond yields move in the opposite direction to the price.\n\n* Coupon: The interest rate that a bond issuer pays, based on the bond's face value.\n\n* Yield: The expected rate of return on a bond, expressed as a percentage. It will fluctuate based on the bond's price. The current yield is a bond's yield divided by its price. A bond trading at a discount to par will have a current yield higher than the coupon. A bond trading at a premium to par will have a current yield below the coupon.\n\n* Yield to maturity: This is an annualized figure that factors in a bond's current market price, the coupon and the capital gain or loss that the investor would take if they were to hold the bond to maturity, because of the premium or discounted price they would pay.\n\n* Yield to call: A bond's yield to call is similar to the yield to maturity, except that it incorporates the next call date and call price on that date, rather than the maturity date.\n\n* Yield to worst: The lower of the yield to maturity and the least favorable yield to call. Typically, this will be the only market-price-based yield figure available when selecting bonds through a brokerage account, which helps simplify comparisons.\n\n* Taxable-equivalent yield: A calculation used to help decide whether the yield on a tax-exempt bond is attractive when compared with that of a fully taxable bond. For an example that leaves aside state and local income taxes, if your annual income was high enough for you to be in the 35% federal tax bracket and you were presented with a municipal bond with a 5% yield, you would divide that yield by 1 less the tax bracket (0.65) for a taxable-equivalent yield of 7.69%.\n\nHigh-yield municipal bonds\n\nTax-exempt municipal bonds are only attractive sources of income if your top graduated federal income-tax rate is high enough to be worth avoiding.\n\nIf you are adding bond-market allocation within a tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, 401(k) or 403(b), municipal bonds aren't appropriate.\n\nWithin the high-yield space, newly issued bonds tend to be sold directly by underwriters to institutional investors. The bonds are typically issued in denominations too high for most individual investors. Another reason that most high-yield investors are professional money managers is that these bonds, by their nature, have a higher risk of default — missed interest or principal payments by the borrowers.\n\nSo the way to invest in high-yield bonds is through bond funds managed by experts who can analyze credit risk and pricing opportunities.\n\nHere is how you can do your own taxable-equivalent calculation in the current market — it is only a quick example, and you would need to look more closely at the yields of any funds or individual bonds you consider investing in.\n\nAs of the close on Tuesday, the Bloomberg Municipal Bond High Yield Index had a yield-to-worst of 5.84%. That was up from 5.52% at the end of last year. You can review federal tax brackets for 2024 at this IRS website. The highest graduated federal income-tax rate for a married couple earning between $201,050 and $383,900 was 24%. We are leaving state and local income taxes out of this discussion.\n\nSo if we divided the 5.84% tax-exempt yield by 0.76, we have a taxable-equivalent yield of 7.68%. In comparison, the Bloomberg U.S. High Yield Corporate Index had a yield-to-worst of 7.42%. So in this example, the investor would receive more interest after tax with the municipal index.\n\nJohn Miller oversees the $6.1 billion First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund, which was known as the First Eagle High Income Fund prior to Dec. 27, 2023. That is when the fund's main objective was changed to its current one of providing dividend income that is exempt from federal income taxes. Capital appreciation is a secondary objective.\n\nThe First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund has two main share classes. Class A FEHAX has annual expenses of 1.13% of assets, however, First Eagle is limiting the expenses to 0.85% at least until Feb. 28, 2026. The Class I shares FEHIX have annual expenses of 0.91%, currently limited to 0.60% at least until Feb. 28, 2026.\n\nThe Class A shares quote a 30-day SEC yield of 5.08%, while the Class I shares had a 30-day distribution rate of 5.45% as of April 30. These yields are net of expenses and meant for comparison with those of other funds.\n\nThe First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund makes monthly distributions, which have been running at $0.036 a share over the past several months for Class A. That makes for an annualized distribution rate of 5.19%, based on Tuesday's closing price of $8.33 for the Class A shares.\n\nFor Class I, monthly distributions have been running at $0.038 a share for the past several months. That distribution rate translates to an annualized distribution rate of 5.48%, based on Tuesday's closing price of $8.32 for the Class I shares.\n\nNavigating the storm\n\nAs of March 31, the First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund's portfolio had 8.2% in cash. Excluding the cash, investment-grade bonds made up 19.8% of the fund as of March 31. The rest of the bonds were unrated or had ratings that were below investment grade.\n\nBack in September, Miller talked about how a municipal bond fund manager could take advantage of market disruptions during times of stress by having \"a combination of cash and highly liquid securities, and maybe a cushion above it, [for] reasonably good preparation for that next downcycle and to cover outflows.\"\n\nSince the fund's strategy was changed to its current one in late December 2023, here is a comparison of total returns from the end of 2023 through Tuesday for its Class A and Class I shares with those of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond High Yield Index and the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, which is comprised mostly of investment-grade bonds. \n\n\n\nThe First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund has outperformed high-yield and investment-grade municipal bond indexes since its strategy was changed late in 2023 to its current one of providing tax-exempt income with capital appreciation as a second objective. PHOTO: FactSet\n\nFrom the end of 2023 through Tuesday, the fund's Class A shares returned 10% with distributions reinvested, compared with a return of 5.27% for the Bloomberg Municipal Bond High Yield Index and a return of 0.17% for the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index.\n\nA look at the long-term performance of the two Bloomberg indexes shows how high-yield municipal bonds have outperformed investment-grade municipal bonds.\n\nHere is a comparison of long-term returns for the two indexes: \n\n Index                                 3-year return   5-year return   10-year return   15-year return   20-year return\n Bloomberg Municipal Bond High Yield   14%             24%             50%              112%             146%\n Bloomberg Municipal Bond              9%              5%              24%              55%              93%\n\n\n\nAnd here are the average annual returns for the same periods: \n\n Index                                 3-year avg. return   5-year avg. return   10-year avg. return   15-year avg. return   20-year avg. return\n Bloomberg Municipal Bond High Yield   4.5%                 4.4%                 4.1%                  5.1%                  4.6%\n Bloomberg Municipal Bond              2.8%                 0.9%                 2.2%                  3.0%                  3.4%\n Source: FactSet\n\n\nAn update from John Miller\n\nAccording to Miller, the municipal bond market is robust. \"Last year we had record issuance. This year, first-quarter issuance was 15% or 16% higher than last year,\" he said. That shows not only the need for municipal financing for infrastructure projects around the U.S., but that there is sufficient demand for the new securities.\n\nHe also said that the market's reaction following Trump's slew of tariff announcements on April 2 was even harsher for municipal bonds than it was for U.S. Treasury bonds, because of lower liquidity for municipal bonds and \"particularly outflows from muni ETFs [exchange-traded funds].\"\n\nWhile the First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund's monthly distributions have remained stable this year, Miller said \"earnings inside the fund are growing because of the opportunity set\" brought about by price declines.\n\nBack in September, when asked to discuss specific bonds held by the First Eagle High Yield Municipal Fund, Miller focused on several bonds issued to support the construction and operations of the Brightline railroad in Florida.\n\nDuring the recent interview, Miller listed five investment-grade bonds held by the fund that he said were \"really attractive.\" The issuers are the Los Angeles Department of Airports to support the Los Angeles International Airport and the New York Transportation Development Corp. to support the redevelopment of two terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The five bonds are exempt from federal income taxes and state and local income taxes for the states in which they were issued.\n\nThe two airports \"have tremendous long-term strategic value and days' cash on hand, traffic and landing fees and all those earnings airports make,\" to support bond payments, he said. \"With airports, you have diversified exposure to all the airlines and they are so important to all our transportation infrastructure.\"\n\nTrading activity for municipal bonds isn't minute-by-minute as it is for stocks of large companies. These five bonds have been trading at premiums to par. They were issued in $5,000 denominations, which means they are far easier for individual investors to consider than most high-yield municipal bonds.\n\nHere is some information from FactSet about the bonds, based on the most recent closing prices when checked early Thursday, with yields-to-worst, which are defined above.

The JFK bonds are rated BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's.\n\nThe JFK bonds have lower ratings and higher yields because that airport \"has more construction going on,\" Miller said.\n\n\"For investment-grade paper, these are some of the highest yields in 20 years,\" he added.\n\nMiller went on to say that he \"would not write off the year, in terms of performance for this asset class, this soon. May 1 is a \"big date for coupon payments and sinking funds,\" he said, with the latter term referring to pools of money set aside by issuers to make sure interest and principal payments will be made.\n\nWhen asked about particular risks from trade-policy uncertainty, Miller said: \"Maybe we will see the hard data begin to soften. The economy has a history of being more resilient than expected.\"\n\nBut municipal bonds \"tend to hold up during a recession,\" he said.",

         "CT Private Equity Trust PLC\n\n28 November 2024 \n\n\n \n To: Stock Exchange   For immediate release: \n                      28 November 2024 \n \n\nCT Private Equity Trust PLC\n\nQuarterly results for the three months ended 30 September 2024 (unaudited)\n\n-- Net asset value of 680.03p per Ordinary Share reflecting a total return for the three months of -1.0 per cent for the Ordinary Shares \n\n\n   --    Share price total return for the three-month period of 6.6%. \n\n-- Total quarterly dividends of 21.03p per Ordinary Share year to date representing an increase of 3.3 per cent from the same period last year.\n\no Quarterly dividend of 7.01p paid on 31 July 2024\n\no Quarterly dividend of 7.01p paid on 31 October 2024\n\no Quarterly dividend of 7.01p to be paid on 31 January 2025 \n\n\n   --    Dividend yield of 6.2 per cent based on the period end share price (1). \n   --    As at 30 September 2024 net debt was GBP70.3 million equivalent to a gearing level of 12.6%. \n\n-- Realisations year to date of GBP94.5 million. This represents an increase of 75.3% in comparison to the same period last year.\n\n(1) Calculated as dividends of 7.01p paid on 30 April 2024, 7.01p paid on 31 July 2024, 7.01p paid on 31 October 2024 and 7.01p payable on 31 January 2025, divided by the Company's share price of 455.00p as at 30 September 2024.\n\nManager's Review\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs at 30 September 2024 the net assets of the Company were GBP486.2 million giving a NAV per share of 680.03p, which taking into account the dividend of 7.01p per share paid on 31 July 2024, gives a total return for the third quarter of -1.0%. The total return for the year to date is -0.2%. In the third quarter, there was an adverse influence from currency of around 1.5% as both the dollar and euro were weak against sterling. Underlying valuations are slightly ahead for the year to date. It is worth bearing in mind that the September valuation is largely based on June marks with only around 8% of September valuations included.\n\nThe Company had net debt of GBP70.3 million at 30 September 2024. Outstanding undrawn commitments were GBP192.0 million of which GBP21.5 million were to funds where the investment period has expired.\n\nThe dividend for the quarter will be unchanged at 7.01p per share, payable on 31 January 2025 to shareholders on the register on 3 January 2025 with an ex-dividend date of 2 January 2025.\n\nNew Investments\n\nThere was only one new investment in the quarter with GBP5 million committed to Inflexion Enterprise Fund VI, the latest in a series of Inflexion funds focusing on lower mid-market buyouts in the UK and Western Europe.\n\nThere were some small follow-on investments in our co-investment portfolio which occurred just after the quarter end. GBP0.9 million was added to the digital payments merchant acquirer Aurora Payment Solutions and GBP0.5 million was added to police and local offence processing software provider Polaris Software (formerly StarTraq).\n\nThe funds in the portfolio made a few notable new investments this quarter.\n\nHG Saturn 3 called GBP1.7 million for three investments in Visma (GBP0.8 million, European and LatAm mission-critical cloud software), Iris (GBP0.7 million, tax and accounting software) and GGW (GBP0.1 million, German insurance brokerage and MGA platform).\n\nMed Platform II invested GBP0.8 million in two companies; Jeisys, a South Korean based producer of energy based medical devices and Irrimax Corporation, a US based wound irrigation and anti-microbial solutions provider. Volpi invested GBP0.8 million in Yaveon (ERP software and consulting provider) and Xalient (software and cybersecurity services provider) and Summa III called GBP0.5 million for Axion (bioelectronic array and live-cell imaging instruments). Inflexion called GBP0.5 million for a carve-out of the healthcare division from AIM-listed GlobalData and GBP0.7 million for DwF, the global legal and professional services firm.\n\nIn total the third quarter was fairly quiet for new investments with drawdowns totalling just GBP9.3 million. Total new investment so far this year amounts to GBP45.2 million which is down on last year by more than 50%.\n\nRealisations\n\nThere were several good exits in the quarter, a number of which have already been reported.\n\nThe largest exit was the sale of the Kester led co-investment in ATEC. The combined proceeds from both the co-investment, the proportion held in the GCP Europe II fund and the proportion held through The Aurora Fund position was GBP18.5 million. This represented an excellent return over the seven-year hold. ATEC is an insurance broker and managing general agent covering caravans, small boats and beach huts. It has grown profits by almost fourfold over the holding period.\n\nThe Buckthorn-led energy services company Coretrax was fully realised during the quarter with the shares with which its acquirer, Expro, bought the company being sold down successfully realising GBP10.3 million bringing the total consideration to GBP13.7 million which at 1.7x cost and 11% IRR is a fair result given the volatile conditions in its sector since the investment was made nearly six years ago.\n\nFrom the funds portfolio there were some excellent further exits.\n\nSumma II sold Olink to Thermo Fisher raising GBP3.6 million. Olink has developed a technology for analysing proteins which is used in human protein biomarker research. The investment achieved a highly creditable 10x cost and an IRR of 67%.\n\nItalian fund Nem Imprese made its final exit with the sale of business processing and outsourcing company Kauri yielding GBP2.1 million.\n\nUK fund RJD Fund III exited veterinary education company Improve International returning GBP1.4 million which represents 3.3x cost and an IRR of 49%.\n\nInflexion Enterprise Fund IV sold pet supplements company Lintbells yielding GBP1.0 million (5.5x and an IRR of 34%).\n\nAstorg VI has made the exits of two companies returning a combined GBP0.9 million. Acturis, a provider of software for the insurance sector (2.6x, 21% IRR) and Audiotonix the designer and manufacturer of premium professional audio equipment and software (2.6x, 25% IRR). In the case of Acturis, Astorg remains invested in the company through its later funds.\n\nIn Finland Vaaka II has achieved a remarkable exit of Cloudpermit, a software company serving building permit and land management functions mainly for municipalities. This has been driven by a shift away from predominantly paper-based process to a digital one, increasing the efficiency of the permitting process. GBP0.7 million was returned which represents 8.7x cost and 53% IRR.\n\nAs can be noted from the above there remains a strong technology theme in the companies achieving strong exits across the portfolio.\n\nTotal realisations in the quarter were GBP42.2 million which brings the year-to-date total to GBP94.5 million, which compares with GBP61.8 million for the whole of 2023.\n\nValuation movements\n\nThe overall valuation movement this quarter is slightly negative. Before taking account of currency movements the underlying portfolio is up by 1.2%. The weakness of both the euro (-1.9%) and the dollar (-5.8%) has resulted in a FX movement in the portfolio of -GBP10.7 million over the quarter, which has more than offset the gains.\n\nThe most notable movements in the quarter are as follows. ATEC (+GBP1.8 million) reflecting its sale at above the latest valuation, Weird Fish (+GBP1.8 million) due to improved trading, Educa Edtech (+GBP1.6 million) also trading well and Ambio (+GBP1.0 million) based on an improved sales multiple. Several of the funds are also up, led by GCP Europe II which holds ATEC (+GBP0.7 million). Avallon III is up by GBP0.6 million due to pet food company MPPK trading well. RJD III (+GBP0.6 million) is up reflecting the sale of Improve International above the holding value as noted above.\n\nOn the negative side there were a few actual downgrades of note. Breeze Group (formerly Contained Air Solutions) was down by GBP1.0 million and Bulgarian bike assembler Leader96 was down by GBP1.5 million. Breeze is in reasonable shape having just completed some useful new additions, with the UK add-on Amercare trading very well in the year to date. Leader96 faces a challenging market which is destocking; however, an agreement with the banks has been reached, part of the old factory has been sold and reinforcement of management is under way. Most of the fund positions were slightly up or slightly down, cancelling out one another.\n\nFinancing\n\nThe Company had net debt at the end of September of GBP70.3 million which is well down from GBP91.3 million at June. This represents gearing of 12.6%. Approximately half of the Company's borrowing facilities are unused with plenty of headroom.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe private equity market internationally has been going through a period of adjustment for most of the last two years. Much higher interest rates and external pressures such as inflation and world events have impacted the dealmaking environment in 2023 and the first half of 2024. The latest trend is more clearly upwards and growth in deal volume and value over 2023 is expected for 2024 as a whole. The clear upswing in realisations across our portfolio confirms this trend. As always business and consumer confidence is an important factor. In many markets, including the US and the UK, 2024 has been an election year and with each of these behind us there is clear scope for a better trend to take root.\n\nPrivate equity is the most interventionist of asset classes where managers can make adjustments as the world around them changes and there is a very strong record of making good returns over the long term irrespective of the background conditions. As we approach the end of 2024, the mood of our investment partners is considerably better than it was earlier in the year and both statistical and anecdotal evidence suggests good grounds for optimism as we finish 2024 and enter 2025. We remain confident that we will continue to build value for Shareholders over the short and longer term.\n\nHamish Mair\n\n\nCT Private Equity Trust PLC Quarterly Results and -2-\n\nInvestment Manager\n\nColumbia Threadneedle Investment Business Limited\n\nPortfolio Summary \n\n\n \n Portfolio Distribution at 30 September            % of Total          % of Total \n  2024                                      30 September 2024    31 December 2023 \n========================================  ===================  ================== \n Buyout Funds -

(Please ensure that these descriptions are updated on the Company's Profile on https://www.otcmarkets.com. Summarize the issuer's business operations (If the issuer does not have current operations, state \"no operations\") Introduction Novus, a legal cannabis health insurance carrier, has built its infrastructure since 2015. It has a national dispensary network and operates under an HMO insurance business model. Novus is currently active in the United States, and the combined projected revenue of the medical and recreational cannabis markets is expected to reach $47 billion by 2024. Novus offers health plans that provide risk and non-risk insurance coverage through its wholly-owned subsidiary, WCIG Insurance Service, Inc. (WCIG), a California insurance entity. WCIG sells nationwide health policies for CBD concentrate and state-specific THC plans. All insurance policies can include coverage for dental, vision, hearing, and telemedicine services. The health plans offered by THC are available in the states listed below: \n\nColorado     California   New York       Massachusetts \nFlorida      Vermont      Ohio           Illinois \nMaryland     Wash DC      Pennsylvania   Maine \nOklahoma     Missouri     Nevada         Nebraska \nHawaii       Michigan     Arizona        Oregon \nNew Mexico                               \n\n\nNovus Business Model Novus is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for cannabis-related products through its health insurance plans. Novus' business model provides value to shareholders, policyholders, and cannabis dispensaries in the following ways: Shareholders:Novus owns receivables (insurance policies) rather than depreciating assets. This means that the cost of hard inventory, manufacturing, delivery vehicles, and warehousing does not weigh down Novus' intrinsic value. Additionally, insurance companies have the highest Benefit Monetization Ratio on Wall Street. This is calculated by dividing the company's price-to-earnings ratio by the total number of policies it monetizes annually. Policyholders:Recreational and medicinal cannabis users who spend $100 or more per month on cannabis qualify for the Novus Cannabis MedPlan. Novus patient members spend an average of $300 monthly and receive a 30% to 45% discount. This translates to a gross savings of $1,800 to $2,338 annually. Additionally, employees can get their policy premiums covered through Employer-Sponsored Health Plans and Health Reimbursement Accounts. Cannabis Verticals:Novus supports dispensaries/verticals at no cost. It drives foot traffic and reimbursements to participating dispensaries and provides free advertising. Novus' HMO commerce model uses a 5-meter geo-fence to target consumers' buying behavior, which is more effective than Google'squarter-mile geo-fence. Novus can deliver advertisements as consumers enter nonparticipating dispensaries and maintain their attention with a retargeting strategy across multiple devices and formats. Benefiting From The Latest Regulations Changes in the regulatory landscape were quite fortunate, with critical factors shaping the cannabis health plan marketplace. * Cannabis Reclassification:Novus Cannabis MedPlan's business model is structured to operate independently of federal cannabis regulations, including potential reclassification or the passage of the SAFE Banking Act. Because Novus doesn't \"touch the plant,\" meaning they don't cultivate, process, distribute, or sell cannabis directly, their operations aren't contingent on the legal status of cannabis at the federal level. They focus on selling policies on a state-by-state basis, adhering to local regulations. Furthermore, their compliant Rx platform, which also avoids direct handling of cannabis, allows them to operate within the existing regulatory framework regardless of federal legislative changes. Therefore, delays in federal cannabis reclassification or the passage of the SAFE Banking Act are not expected to impact Novus Cannabis MedPlan's current business operations directly. * The Compassionate Care Act: Employees are protected from termination for using medical cannabis, which leads the way for employer-sponsored health plans that cover medical cannabis under their offerings. * The Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing ActProhibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from denying VA benefits to 19 million veterans who participate in a state-approved cannabis program(s). * Opioid Settlement Framework: Many State Attorney Generals settled on $50 billion in compensatory damages, rehabilitation, and opioid diversion programs. Novus proposes the use of its Cannabis MedPlan as a compelling option to comply with the settlement diversion programs. * Taxation: Legislative reform will create higher taxes on recreational cannabis. In California, many recreational consumers are converting to medicinal users, taking advantage of 50% tax breaks along with significant discounts that Novus Cannabis MedPlan offers. * Credit Cards and Safe Banking Act: Novus has established a relationship with Authorize.net, a leading credit card processing platform. Novus' workaround strategy was not to touch or sell the plant; we provide insurance benefits to policyholders, which appears to be satisfactory. Therefore, the Safe Banking Act does not directly affect its business model. * California SB1186 Medicinal Patients' Right of Access: State bill SB 1186 will help to expand safe access to medical cannabis throughout the state dramatically. Once passed, this will significantly increase the Novus provider network from dispensaries to doctor's offices, urgent care facilities, hospitals, and managed healthcare. Just like the Employee Compassionate Care Act, there will be states following suit on similar legislation. * Providers : Many cultivators are adopting selling direct-to-consumer and are using delivery platforms to sell their products regionally, opening up a new segment in our provider network. One of Novus' providers, Budee, has one such platform covering California with four distribution centers and 800 daily deliveries. This allows Novus to consolidate its provider network, where policyholders can order from the digital platforms of their choice and get their product(s) within an hour. * Worker's Comp : Novus solved this problem by implementing a cannabis medical plan as a diversion to overprescribing opioids, complying with the Opioid Settlement Framework.ALLIANCES Alignment With Carriers and Third-Party Administrators Since its inception, Novus has effortlessly endeavored to gain the interest of Third-Party Administrators who manage major carriers' employee benefits. Then, a series of breakthroughs occurred. Carriers use our cannabis benefit packages as an enticement to procure new customers and as a mechanism to upsell to current members, boosting Novus from being a Discount Medical Plan to anetwork of designated healthcare providers with the premier level of full coverage. Adoption of Embedded Insurance: In the past ten years, the number of cannabis users grew by almost 20 million, making an estimated 12% of Americans consume cannabis, and each consumer has their own personality traits. Prompting management to adapt to its marketing and sales arsenal, Embedded Insurance. This digital bundling form enables retailers from nearly any industry to offer insurance policies as an add-on or feature for online or in-store checkout. This is a self-sustaining Insurance Ecosystem Solution through a business-to-business-to-consumerinsurance partnership between Novus and retailers. For example, an airline might present travel insurance just as a consumer is booking plane tickets. A study by Accenturefound that \"customers are increasingly willing to consider insurance purchases while shopping for other needs. The study concluded that 60% ofconsumers want to buy more from brands they trust and love the convenience of embedded experiences. Retail brands that tap into the market by offering Embedded Insurance gain a huge opportunity to build new recurring revenue streams and deepen their relationships with existing customers. With the right partners, Embedded Insurance can quickly realize revenue from an insurance offering and innovative ways to distribute our benefit packages. Adoption of In-House D2C Online Pharmacy: Management has planned to expand healthcare options for cannabis policyholders. We've canceled our agreement with Canadian Pharmacy, Plitio, and will launch our own Rx Platform in August 2024. Novus allows cannabis brands to reach policyholders and consumers without setup or listing fees. The platform enables direct sales between brands and the beneficiaries, providing pre-negotiated discounts and potential reimbursements for policyholders. Novus aims to attract both registered and unregistered users, including recreational users, by offering affordable wellness programs with customized insurance benefits. In the future, the platform will integrate pharmaceutical medications, bridging the gap between conventional and cannabis medicine for a more comprehensive healthcare approach. Health Carrier and Wholesale Contracts : Below are carriers of health plans and wholesales that are integrating Novus Cannabis MedPlan into their health plan offering * PRAM: Begin a market rollout for its subscriber base.

Management Discussion and Analysis Strategy and Outlook According to Forbes, by 2025, 5.4 million Americans, or 2.4% of U.S. adults, will be registered patients in medical cannabis states. However, the rising prices and added federal taxation on recreational products have not been considered. Novus' unique business model addresses this challenge by applying cannabis benefits to health plans. This will make cannabis more affordable for consumers, with 30%- 35% discounts on purchases and a 15%- 17% reduction of taxes at the point of sale. Employer-Sponsored Health Plans Novus is experiencing a breakthrough in penetrating the small to midsized businesses (SMB) market with its cannabis-integrated health insurance plans. Many SMBs are eager to compete and expand, and offering competitive health benefits is essential. Cannabis benefits are a compliant and attractive way to do this, especially as healthcare costs continue to rise. Employers are also rewriting cannabis policies in light of state Supreme Court rulings that protect employees who use cannabis legally. Novus is experiencing strong demand from health carriers and aggregators, which are embedding Novus' plans into their benefits packages. This confirms Novus' assessment that health insurance carriers prefer acquiring market share rather than creating one.

How Cannabis Companies Use Novus' Business Model to Boost Value Shareholders will demand greater profitability from cannabis verticals, which Novus will address by tailoring health plan designs to offer pass-through rebates/discounts on cannabis medications in the form of \"Usage-based Health Plans.\" This strategy allows policyholders to keep cannabis medications affordable while maintaining higher volume, attractive profit margins, and dedicated foot traffic for the cannabis verticals. Conclusion Changes in regulations have dramatically transformed the scope of our business model. Over the past two years, health carriers have not fully accepted the Novus Cannabis MedPlan. Today, we see total acceptance. Novus has a clear first-mover advantage with its developed provider network, which offers the best value for cannabis consumers. The cannabis stock index has had a difficult journey, but Novus will continue to grow despite the challenges. Our receivable-based business model creates limited overhead and contributes directly to the company's profits when a policyholder is procured and makes a premium payment. Novus protects its shareholders by not excessively issuing stock from treasury and by using its mandatory leak-out provision to deter third-party vendors from damaging the stock price with irresponsible selling pressure in the market. * List any subsidiaries, parent company, or affiliated companies. * WCIG Insurance Services Inc.

         "A self-insured retention (SIR) in an insurance policy requires the insured (in our case, a bankrupt debtor) to pay the first dollars settled or awarded on a covered plaintiff's claim, up to a predetermined amount, e.g., $100,000 or $250,000 (or whatever amount is negotiated with the insurer). The insurance company becomes obligated to pay the remainder of the claim—up to its per claim or per policy limits—only after the insured has met its SIR obligation. SIRs benefit the insured/debtor via decreased policy premiums insofar as the insurance company sits further away from risk of payment. It benefits the insurance company by ensuring that the insured has \"skin in the game,\" insofar as the insured becomes the first line of defense and thereby is incented to resolve claims below the SIR exposure.\n\nThe Conundrum When a Company With a Self-Insured Retention Files for Bankruptcy\n\nWhen a debtor files for bankruptcy, legal issues arise in connection with the SIR. The automatic stay, codified at 11 U.S.C. Section 362, prevents a debtor from paying prepetition claims; yet, the insurance contract requires the debtor to do just that in order to trigger the insurer's obligation to pick up the remainder owed to the plaintiff. Bankruptcy law also requires fairness in treatment among similarly situated creditors. Paying a plaintiff the SIR amount, while other creditors remain unpaid, would violate this principle. Thus the conundrum arises, i.e., a legal and contractual standoff between bankruptcy law and contract law—an insurance contract that requires satisfaction of the SIR before the insurer's obligation to pay arises.\n\nHow Courts Have Addressed the Conundrum\n\nStatutory and Public Policy Bases for Resolving the Conundrum\n\nSome courts have resolved this conundrum by invoking public policy considerations. These decisions typically hinge on whether or not the applicable jurisdiction has a statute requiring that bankruptcy filings by insured parties do not absolve insurers from fulfilling policy obligations and requiring that all insurance agreements include a clause that an insured's bankruptcy filing will not relieve the insurance company for damages or losses under an existing policy. For example:\n\nIn Admiral Insurance v. Grace Industries, 409 B.R. 275, 282 (E.D.N.Y. 2009), the court ruled that an insurer's liability persists even when the insured cannot exhaust self-insured retention obligations due to the bankruptcy, citing New York Insurance Law Section 3420, (\"Bankruptcy does not relieve the insurance company of its obligation to pay damages for injuries or losses covered under an existing policy.\"); See Diocese of Camden, New Jersey, 653 B.R. 309, 351 (Bankr. D.N.J. 2023) (noting in a decision on whether an insurance policy is executory that \"there is caselaw finding that payment of the SIRs are not prerequisites to the Insurers obligation to pay, and instead merely set a floor on the claim amounts below which the Insurers have not agreed to make any payments.\").\n\nIn Vanderveer Estates Holding, 328 B.R. 18, 24 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2005), aff'd sub nom. American Safety Indemnity v. Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, No. 05 CV 5877 ARR, 2006 WL 2850612 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2006) (applying Illinois law), the court underscored the Illinois public policy which prioritized compensation for injured parties, irrespective of the debtor's ability to pay its SIR. (\"The plain language of section 388 [under the Illinois Insurance Code] makes clear the legislative intent to prevent insurers from using the insured's bankrupt condition and resulting inability to make actual payment to satisfy a judgment or any portion thereof as grounds to avoid payment on a policy . . . the operative effect of the language of the self-insured provision is 'directly contrary to the public policy as declared by the legislative enactment of section 388 [of the Illinois Insurance Code].'\") (Home Insurance of Illinois v. Hooper, 294 Ill. App. 3d 626, 632, 691 N.E.2d 65, 70 (1998)).\n\nHowever, even in jurisdictions that do not have a prevailing statute governing the insurer's liability, courts still have found that public policy concerns dictate that a bankruptcy filing does not relieve the insurer of its liability even if the debtor-insured cannot satisfy its SIR obligations. See Sturgill v. Beach at Mason Limited Partnership, 2015 WL 6163787, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 20, 2015) (holding that even in the absence of an Ohio statute requiring the inclusion of bankruptcy clauses, an insurance policy that contains a bankruptcy provision still requires insurer to satisfy amounts above the SIR).\n\nA minority view holds in certain instances where there is no prevailing bankruptcy statute, a court may enforce the plain language of an insurance policy that states that insurer obligations will only be triggered upon satisfaction of the SIR. In particular, applying Alabama law, a bankruptcy court held that an insurer's duty to defend and indemnify was only triggered after the SIR was satisfied. Apache Products, 311 B.R. 288, 293 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2004). \"Where the language in an insurance policy is unambiguous and does not offend against public policy, it must be accorded its plain meaning and it must be enforced as written.\"(Criterion Insurance v. Anderson, 347 So.2d 384, 388 (Ala.1977)). Absent a governing statute addressing the impact of a bankruptcy on a SIR policy, these courts have determined that based on the plain language of the SIR clause, the insurer has no liability until the SIR amount has been exhausted. \"One cannot escape the plain language of the Lexington policy. Apache must exhaust the SIR amount before Lexington's obligation to defend arises.\" Apache Products, 311 B.R. at 297. However, the court specifically left open the issue of payment once there was an adjudication against the debtor in excess of the SIR that the debtor would be unable to \"apply\" or \"exhaust.\" 298 (\"This court is equally satisfied that the issue is not ripe for consideration of whether or not Wheelwright is applicable once there is an adjudication against Apache in excess of the $100,000 SIR as set forth in the Lexington policies for which Apache is unable to 'apply' or 'exhaust' as a result of its filing for Chapter 11 relief and what effect, if any the filing of the bankruptcy case has on this provision of the Lexington policy.\").\n\nIn Pak-Mor Manufacturing v. Royal Surplus Lines Insurance, 2005 WL 3487723 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 3, 2005), a court applying Texas law held that an insurer is not obligated to pay anything until the insured pays the retained limit where the policy states that the insurer's obligations will not \"attach or arise\" unless or until the SIR is satisfied. The court in Pak-Mor, however, did not define what constitutes satisfaction, leaving open the question as to whether \"satisfaction\" of an allowed general unsecured claim on the SIR would trigger insurer liability: \"Yet the plain meaning of 'pay' does not indicate a required method of payment. To the contrary, the standard dictionary definition leaves it open: 'to discharge indebtedness for.' Common usage does as well; people often speak of paying by check or money order, paying in cash, and paying by credit card. Even Black's Law Dictionary fails to confuse the matter: 'performance of an obligation by the delivery of money or some other valuable thing accepted in partial or full discharge of the obligation.'\"\n\nCourts may find that a debtor has satisfied its SIR obligations if a Chapter 11 plan treats the SIR obligations consistent with the underlying policy and allows claimants an unsecured claim for the SIR portion of their recovery. That claim could arguably be \"satisfied,\" for example, by a partial distribution of funds under the bankruptcy plan, and a discharge of the remaining amount of the claim under the confirmation order. See,generally, the \"dictionary definition of \"satisfied\" cited in Pak-Mor, above. For example, in one case, a debtor had two contested malpractice claims pending and each claimant was separately classified with an allowed unsecured claim. See Keck, Mahin & Cate, 241 B.R. 583 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1999). The prevailing insurance policy included a SIR obligation of $1 million. 595-96. The insurer alleged that the plan would allow the debtor to avoid its SIR obligations. The court ruled that the SIR was satisfied by the debtor's allowance of an unsecured claim for the SIR and the claimants acceptance of the plan. \"The SIRs are to be satisfied in exactly the same way as every other unsecured claim against the debtor. The policy condition to ALAS's liability that the debtor 'pay' costs and amounts due on the claim 'as they become due' up to the amount of the SIR will be satisfied under the plan. An obligation to pay is satisfied when something of value is given and accepted in full discharge of that obligation.\"\n\nMust the Insurer Pay the Debtor's Unpaid SIR to a Plaintiff?\n\nCourts that have allowed a plaintiff to proceed against the insurance company despite the bankrupt insured's SIR amount not being otherwise exhausted have made it clear that the insurance company is not required to pay out the self-insured retention amount in any settlement or judgment entered with or for the plaintiffs. Instead, courts have held the insurer liable solely for all damages over and above the SIR amount and then relegated the injured party to an unsecured claim against the bankrupt debtor for the SIR amount. See Kleban v. National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh, Pa., 771 A.2d 39 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2001) (determining that to the extent any award against the debtor was within the SIR, the injured party could assert an unsecured claim against the debtor or its estate. If the amount was above, the insurer would satisfy that amount less the SIR.);See Amatex, 107 B.R. 856 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1989) (denying a debtor's request that the insurer cover the full policy limit and file an unsecured claim against the debtor for the SIR amount, noting that \"the self-insured retention is therefore not an amount that is owed by the debtor to Stonewall but rather, represents the threshold of Stonewall's liability to the debtor.\"); The Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, 319 B.R. 266, 269 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2004) (finding that the stay should be lifted to allow the injured party to proceed with its claim against the insurer but that the insurer's liability was only as to the amounts over and above the SIR amount and that the injured party would be limited to filing an unsecured claim against the debtor for amounts up and until the SIR was exhausted).\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether rooted in statutory analysis of state law, or public policy concerns, a majority of courts hold that insurance companies must step up and pay amounts due and owing over and above SIR amounts, even where a bankruptcy debtor is unable to pay. The courts do, however, continue to navigate the balance between public policy considerations present in bankruptcy matters, e.g., a fair distribution among creditors, and the explicit terms of insurance agreements.\n\nReprinted with permission from the April 16, 2025 edition of the New Jersey Law Journal © 2025 ALM Global Properties, LLC.

         "23.05.2024 / 08:00 CET/CEST\n\n* Strengthening of a unique NGO-corporation collaboration model that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation.\n\n* Extension of multi-year agreement that started in 2018, focusing on five strategic projects across the globe.\n\n* By 2026, ambitious target to recover over 300 thousand hectares of degraded land in Cerrado Brazil and regenerate agricultural soils in China with a focus to impact the agricultural sector for the adaption of sustainable farming practices. In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate resilience of crop land\n\n* Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and nature.\n\n23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USA\n\nSyngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their successful collaboration that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration in 2018.\n\nThe new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects and focuses on further advancing business practices with the goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China, and the United States.\n\nThe collaboration embodies Syngenta’s commitment to regenerate soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide sustainability priorities announced in April 2024.\n\nPetra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: “We are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.”\n\nRestoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the US\n\nSyngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company.\n\nThe goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE® program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Itaú BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria.\n\nMichael Doane, Global Managing Director Food & Freshwater Systems, TNC: “REVERTE® aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.”\n\nAs of March 2024, REVERTE® has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome.\n\nChina: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group’s fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group’s recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028.\n\nUnited States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland’s climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers. Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects and partners with academia and industry around the world – demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.\n\nSyngenta Group and TNC will hold a LinkedIn Live event on the partnership progress. Tzutzuy Ramirez and Roberto Castro, Syngenta, and Michael Wironen and Rodrigo Spuri, TNC, will discuss how the partners will continue to develop their unique NGO-corporation collaboration model and what the plans are for the future. The event will be hosted on the Syngenta LinkedIn page on Wednesday, May 29 at 14.30 CET\n\nAbout Syngenta Group\n\nSyngenta Group is one of the world’s biggest agricultural technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

         "The battle, analysts said, may not be in the best interest of its banking subsidiary, FirstBank, which is expected to raise its capital for international banking licence authorisation.\n\nOn recapitalisation, the new require­ments are to ensure banks have a robust capital base to absorb unexpected loss­es and the capacity to contribute to the growth and development in Ni­geria, the central bank said, after the government set a goal of a $1 trillion economy by 2030.\n\nBigger banks with larger capital bases and capacity “can underwrite larger levels of credit, which is critical to lubricate and catalyse the economy’s growth,” it said.\n\nThe regulator set the new cap­ital base for commercial banks with international licences at N500 billion (up from N50 bil­lion, or $36.5 million) while the requirement for national and regional lenders went up to N200 billion and N50 billion, respective­ly (from N25 billion and N10 bil­lion). Non-interest lenders’ capital was raised to N20 billion, and N10 billion for regional licences (from five billion naira).\n\nOptions for meeting the re­quirements include injecting fresh capital through private placements, rights issues and/ or offers for subscription; merg­ers and acquisitions; and/or up­grades or downgrades of licence authorisation.\n\nBanks have a period of 24 months to comply with the new minimum capital requirements.\n\nThe timeline is between April 1, 2024 and March 31, 2026.\n\nIt is safe to say that the 24-month timeline is wide enough for banks to gradually comply with the requirement. It is com­mendable that banks are given two years; this would forestall disruption and instability in the sector and allow for a gradual and smooth transition.\n\nThe CBN requires banks to submit to it their implementation plan and strategy in response to the recapitalisation circular. The implementation plan is to show which of the available options the bank has chosen in reaction to the 2024 recapitalisation policy. The deadline for the submission of the implementation plan was set for April 31, 2024.\n\nFor instance, the unending le­gal battle with some shareholders resulted in the annual general meetings of the company being suspended for the second year running.\n\nA Lagos Federal High Court halted FBN Holdings’ 12th AGM, initially scheduled for August 22, at the request of shareholder, To­hir Folorunsho Ismaila, the latest of a growing list of shareholders standing in the way of the bank’s crucial annual meeting.\n\nThe virtual meeting, which was postponed until September 3, according to a notice by the bank on the NGX, was supposed to be the place to get shareholders’ approval for an N350 billion cap­ital raise in the form of a public offering, rights issue or private placement.\n\nThe bank had in April an­nounced plans to raise capital through the issuance of shares via a public offering, private placement or rights issue in the Nigerian or international capital markets.\n\nAnalysts believe that these multiple court cases, which have cast a shadow on its AGMs, are also capable of derailing the pros­pects of raising capital for the future of its banking subsidiary, FirstBank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShareholders including Oluse­gun Samuel Onagoruwa, Kujen­ya Olayiwola Yusuf and Hakeem Lawal-Oluwa, have initiated law­suits to challenge the legitimacy of the AGMs, citing violations of court orders that prohibited such meetings.\n\nSeveral cases are in various stages of court proceedings, with some adjourned pending appeals and others awaiting judgment.\n\nOlusegun Samuel Onagoru­wa vs. FBN Holdings (FBHN) – In the simmering feud between Olusegun Samuel Onagoruwa, an accountant and shareholder, and FBN Holdings, the battle lines were drawn long before the ink could dry on the 10th annual gen­eral meeting (AGM) notice.\n\nOnagoruwa, the driving force behind his firm, Segun Onagoru­wa & Co., has fought since 2022 to halt the AGM in its tracks. Armed with a court order suspending all AGM-related actions, he and his legal team have steadfastly resist­ed FBNH’s relentless attempts to lift this judicial blockade.\n\nReacting to fear by some shareholders on the develop­ment, Moses Igbrude, National Coordinator of the Independent Shareholders Association of Ni­geria (ISAN), said the fear is not out of place.\n\nHe said, “Yes, it’s not out of place for some shareholders to ex­ercise such fear. Nobody is okay with what is happening. People would be worried that such a thing has happened to their company.\n\n“There are no stakeholders that will not be concerned about this thing. There are no stakehold­ers that will not be concerned”.\n\nHe added that those who are in court should remember that the company belongs to all.\n\nHe added, “They should be aware that their investment is on the line too and if anything happens to the company, it will affect them.\n\n“So, what I think we should do is that every stakeholder should engage because we are all in it. As stakeholders, we are engaging the people and parties involved to make sure that this issue is resolved timely so that it will not affect this ongoing recap­italisation process.\n\n“So, let’s be hopeful that these people, the stakeholders involved, all of them, will come to reason and withdraw these cases from court and allow the extraordi­nary general meeting (EGM) to be held. Some of us are working. No matter what happens, we are en­gaging the stakeholders towards bringing the agitation to a stop”.\n\nHe stressed that the most im­portant thing to do at a time like this is to be hopeful that an ami­cable ground should be achieved and the company will move for­ward.\n\nContinuing, he said, “From all indications, warring factions should know that they should be aware and conscious that what­ever they do to keep the lingering crisis on will affect the fortunes of the company and their invest­ments.\n\n“We, in ISAN, are engaging various factions and we are tell­ing them that any action they take could affect the process. So, they are aware and we are doing all of this to make sure that all issues are resolved and all court cases are withdrawn”.\n\nBoniface Okezie, another prominent shareholder activist and Coordinator of the Progres­sive Shareholders Association of Nigeria (PSAN), advised warring factions to sheathe their sword and work for the betterment of the financial institution and its subsidiary.\n\nHe said, “I am hopeful that this phase will pass. It is only the dead that don’t have hope. They should keep their swords and let peace reign because the bank must breathe fresh air, so they plan for the recapitalisation exercise.\n\n“The way forward is for the Se­curities and Exchange Commis­sion (SEC) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to mandate CSCS and Meristem to produce the final register they have updat­ed which will give the authentic list of each and everyone’s hold­ings as contained in that register. In an atmosphere that we cur­rently have, no progress will be achieved”.",

Timothy Arcuri - UBS,Analyst\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCompany Summary\n\nFINANCIAL DATA\n\n1. Undetermined Undetermined cash = $ 800.0\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nPresentation\n\n1. So just to start with, I wanted to open with microchip's recent leadership change which has seen you return as the interim CEO and announcements you made yesterday that, that you know, revenues are at the low end of guidance and that FAB two will be closed.\n\n2. You know, it is not weeks, it's, it's much longer you know, microchip is, if you look at our performance today, we're down 55% in revenue from the peak 1,000 BPS down in gross margin, 2000 BPS down in operating profit, severe cash crunch.\n\n3. We're not producing enough cash to pay a dividend.\n\n4. We had a peak revenue which was more than two x of our current revenue and we were adding capacity to grow beyond that.\n\n5. So at the current revenue level and with any kind of expected growth, even even significant growth, we got inventory just incredible amount of, incred, incredible amount of capacity and in trying to keep those fabs with some reasonable utilization, we have continued to build inventory and we just can't do that anymore.\n\n6. So yesterday, we decided to close down one fab, fab two, which is our smallest fab.\n\n7. Two in Germany, we have a plant in Ireland, we got three in Massachusetts.\n\n8. Last quarter, the inventory and our balance sheet was 246 days and this quarter was going to go to 276 days and that was before we lowered the guidance yesterday.\n\n9. And outside inventory, what we buy from foundries is about 234 days.\n\n10. Inventory is closer to 300 days.\n\n11. Systems is 10% of our business where we build the boards and, systems and development tools and others.\n\n12. We have 25 business units in the company.\n\n13. When you know, growth was very higher, gross margin was very high.\n\n14. That was number seven, number eight is on the up side of the equation and a today, 35% of our revenue.\n\n15. So when we have a full quarter of full pay, the AEX in dollars will rise plus in the first quarter, all the FICA comes back for the higher paid people because usually in the 3rd and 4th quarter, the company matching for the FICA is not there.\n\n16. And, you know, today we have too much capacity and, government gives you $0.15 of every dollar you spend.\n\n17. I want to spend $100 million to get $15 million back from the government.\n\n18. I have the concern on the downside because, for four or five quarters we've been calling it a bottom and we're probably still, you know, dribbling at the bottom and the current quarter is down, what, 12% from last quarter sequentially.\n\n19. You know, today, we there is probably $800 million to a billion dollars of excess cash tied up in inventory and CapEx.\n\n20. And by combination of all those get the free cash flow above where our dividend is.\n\n21. There is, there's no plan to cut the dividend dividend is not at risk.\n\n22. But as we liberate cash and the cash flow becomes higher than the dividend, then we'll take the remaining upside cash and pay back down this loan that we're borrowing right now to pay the dividend once we have done that, and the total debt has gone back to where it was pre borrowing for dividend and we have more money left over, then we'll have a conversation, what we do with it, that's not, immediately in the next quarter or so.\n\n23. We, we've quantified the last three quarters that spent about $100 million per quarter that the distribution sell out has been in excess of what we're selling in and we expect something around that again this quarter.\n\n24. So historically, you know what we have said is, China is 18% of our business and half of that business is selling to multinationals who are doing manufacturing in China.\n\n25. We have 20,000 micro controllers, distinct micro controllers parted with USB Ethernet, Wi Fi Bluetooth tw MS, low power, high power, high speed, low speed pin counts eight pin, 16 pin, 32 pin, 40 pin, 68 P I.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI, ANALYST, UBS: So just to start with, I wanted to open with Microchip's recent leadership change, which has seen you return as the interim CEO, and announcements you made yesterday that revenues are at the low end of guidance and that Fab 2 will be closed. So I just wanted to open it up and see if you wanted to say anything about that.\n\nSTEVE SANGHI, CHAIR OF THE BOARD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT, MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INC: Sure. So let me sort of start with the leadership change. I want to start by thanking Ganesh Moorthy, who worked for Microchip for 23 years. And he was a very hard worker, had a number of positions at Microchip for five years, from 2016 to 2021. He was the President when I was CEO, and he was too in the box with me.\n\nI couldn't have had a better wingman. He was just a great executor when I pointed him in the right direction. And then in 2021, I stepped down from the CEO role, and he became the CEO. And the results, especially in this cycle and the last couple of years, Microchip has substantially underperformed. So he stepped down from his role and retired.\n\nI had retired completely. I actually had moved out of the Valley. I still had a house here, but I was living in Prescott, in the mountains, having fun, hiking peaks, navigating lakes and playing with the grandkids and family. And then Board asked me if I would step back in. And I, with my team, built this company for 31 years. And when the duty called, I couldn't say no. So here I am. I moved back in the house in the last week.\n\nSo one of the questions people have, two questions people have is, what does interim mean? My title is Interim CEO and President. And number two, what am I going to do different? So the definition of interim is I'll be in this role for as long as it is necessary. It is not weeks. It's much longer. Microchip, if you look at our performance today, we're down 55% in revenue from the peak, 1,000 bps down in gross margin; 2,000 bps down in operating profit; severe cash crunch, we're not producing even enough cash to pay our dividend, we're borrowing money to pay dividend.\n\nSo I kind of look at it as a turnaround story almost. And we need to get all these things fixed before there is even a thought of another CEO transition. So there's no search out today.\n\nWe're not looking for another CEO. I'm it for a while, whether you like me or not. So I keep going, I just didn't want to have you get cut off from your question.\n\nSo what am I going to do? I'm on a massive, with a sense of urgency, program to review the entire Microchip from top to bottom in the next 90 days. And I'm going to give you a nine point plan that we're going to look at.\n\nThe first one is resizing the manufacturing footprint. So Microchip's manufacturing footprint today is too large. We had a peak revenue, which was more than 2x our current revenue, and we were adding capacity to grow beyond that. And some of that capacity is installed and much of that capacity is not even installed. It's an equipment sitting in our fabs that we can install and go substantially above our prior peak.\n\nSo at the current revenue level and with any kind of expected growth, even significant growth, we got inventory, just incredible amount of capacity. And in trying to keep those fabs with some reasonable utilization, we have continued to build inventory, and we just can't do that anymore. We're drowning.\n\nSo yesterday, we decided to close down one Fab, Fab 2, which is our smallest fab. And a lot of people have been asking the question that by closing that fab, are we cutting off our upside. I'm really not worried about the upside. We have so much capacity and so much inventory. It was the smallest fab.\n\nThe other fabs are capable of doing 3x of what they're doing today. So the upside is not an issue. So that's number one.\n\nAnd so this is resizing just the fab, but we have other factories. We have 4 factories, large factories, in the back end, two in Thailand, two in Philippines. And we have other smaller fabs around the world, 2 in Germany. We have a plant in Ireland. We've got three in Massachusetts. So all that structure, I'm going to look at it and review what needs to be combined, what needs to be done what.\n\nSo the second issue is the inventory, which is tied to the capacity. For 31 years I ran Microchip as a CEO, I never had inventory go higher than 135 days on our balance sheet. Last quarter, the inventory in our balance sheet was 246 days. And this quarter was going to go to 276 days. And that was before we lowered the guidance yesterday.\n\nSo it's going to go higher than that. And the outside inventory, what we buy from foundries, is about 234 days. So the inside inventory is even higher than the number I gave you. It's probably closer to 300 or higher. That's over 2x the inventory.\n\nI mean it's just like way too much. Enough is enough. So we're going to aggressively bring the inventory down. Our inventory is too high even on the foundry. So we're dramatically cutting starts from the foundry to bring that inventory down. The system inventory is closer to 300 days. Systems is 10% of our business, where we build the boards and systems and development tools and others. And why does it have 300 days of inventory, it should be 100 days lower, so I'm going to mount a program to bring that down.\n\nThe third one is there are a lot of growth initiatives in the company. There is mega trends, there is TSS, there is AI. And I need to review each one of those programs and see what is working, what is not working, maybe take one away, maybe add one, add more resources to this because there's higher potential, take resources from this because it's not working as well. And so I'm going to do that entire review in the next 90 days.\n\nAnd then the fourth one is a review of the business unit. We have 25 business units in the company. We actually, every quarter, see 25 P&Ls. And some of the business units are quite small. They were started for a reason maybe 5 years ago, 10 years ago.\n\nIs that reason still valid? Is that promise still there? In some cases, maybe it's not. So they should be combined or closed or sold, or I'm just going to review everything and see what needs to be changed. So that's the fourth.\n\nThe fifth one is the channel strategy. So you're aware of significant changes in the distribution strategy in our industry where many other companies have done. Microchip channel strategy hasn't changed in several years. We do business with about 100 distributors around the world. Some are global, some are regional, some are catalog.\n\nAnd I'm going to do a comprehensive review of that channel strategy to see what are we paying everybody. Is that too much? Or is that too little? Should something be terminated? Should something be added? And I think the whole channel strategy need to be looked at again.\n\nNumber six is strengthening our customer relationships. I think in the times of extreme shortage and after that, when the industry came down and there were a large number of non-cancellable, non-reschedulable orders on our books and, in certain cases, customers didn't want the product but since we helped them in good times, in bad times, we wanted them to help us and keep taking that product, I think we stressed certain relationships.\n\nAnd call it an apology tour, call it forgiveness tour, I think we are on it, and we've got 125,000 customers, we cannot visit them all, but we need to take top 5,000 customers and ensure that we love them, but do they still love us. And some of them have six months of inventory. They're not buying as much from us today because they have inventory. But when the inventory runs out, are they still our customers? Are they going to still buy from us when we have the next design,\n\nI think we do. I think it's okay. But we just need a falling on the sword and apologize and give them some TLC and ensure that our customer relationships are strengthened.\n\nNumber seven is the business model. Now our business model that we have still has a remnant of elements from peak performance. When growth was very high, gross margin was very high. There were expedited charges. There were price increases.\n\nCustomer is willing to do anything to get the parts. And the operating expense percentage was very low because the revenue was so high and you couldn't add operating expenses fast enough. So the business model that is still in our presentation, which has been taken out, really had remnants of peak performance in a super cycle, which is not representative of the real world. So I'm going to recast that in 90 days. I don't know what changes will happen in there.\n\nWhen I look at it on the gross margin side, actually some of our businesses that are higher than corporate gross margin are doing better than our businesses that are lower than corporate gross margin. So gross margin could actually be accretive for all I know. But there is also pricing pressure, things happening in China.\n\nSo there are things on both sides of the ledger, and I need to put it all, process it all together and see what the new growth number is, what the new gross margin is, operating expenses, and give that business model to you and then aggressively execute to get there. So that was number seven.\n\nNumber eight is on the OpEx side of the equation. Our OpEx today is 35% of our revenue, and that was before we lowered the revenue yesterday, so it's even higher. Plus, all year, we have been on a pay cut. That pay cut was reversed two Fridays ago just before I joined. It was the decision made before.\n\nSo when I look at the next quarter, the full pay will be for the entire quarter. And when that happens, so when we have a full quarter of full pay, the OpEx in dollars will rise some. Plus, in the first quarter, all the FICA comes back for the higher-paid people because usually, in the third and fourth quarter, the company matching part of FICA is not there. So I think I'm concerned that the operating expense goes higher and gets farther away from a model that I like to see at.\n\nSo what needs to be done? What portion of it will actually self-correct when the revenue comes back? And what portion doesn't come back and we need to do something in terms of weeding and feeding, and business units or whatever? So that's just a question right now. I don't have the answer to that.\n\nAnd the final one, number nine is review the CHIPS grant. The grant was applied to maybe almost a year ago when everybody thought that the factory capacity was never enough and the world is going to build silicon fabs forever. And today, we have too much capacity. And government gives you $0.15 of every dollar you spend. Do I want to spend $100 million to get $15 million back from the government?\n\nIf I don't need it, then I don't want to spend the other $85 million myself. So I don't know what the answer would be. With 10 days back at the job, I just need to reopen that. I have put the negotiations with CHIPS office on hold for now until I get my arms around it. And probably by the time I get my arms around it, we're into the new administration.\n\nI don't know what their take is, which people they put, is the money still available. But whatever happens, then we will deal with it.\n\nSo that's kind of what I'm going to do. And the plan is to get this accomplished in 90 days, which is a Herculean task. I don't know how much of it gets done, but that's what the attempt would be. And we'll bring some of the output back to you probably at one of the conferences in March and give you some update. So that's kind of where I am.\n\nSorry for the long answer.\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI: That's great. Thank you, Steve. As I hear you talk and I think about how sharp the recovery could be for Microchip in particular, given just the depth of how far things have come down, I would think that when things come back, they come back pretty sharply and more sharply for you than maybe some of your peers. Now that might be a while from now, we can debate when that is. But the pace of the recovery ought to be pretty quick because of your reliance on distribution and all those factors.\n\nSo how much does that come into your mind when you're thinking about these cuts? You don't want to overcut. I mean, you've been around a long time. You've seen a lot of these cycles.\n\nSTEVE SANGHI: So I'll answer the second part of your question regarding the cut and then maybe Eric can answer how sharp the recovery can be.\n\nI'm not worried about the upside portion of it. I take the example of, if you ask me to hit the bull's eye, the chance for me to hit the bull's eye is 0. But if you say, make sure that you're on the left of it and never go right, then I can do it every time. I'm not worried about the right side of it, the upside of it, because we have so much inventory and so much capacity. Even after closing this fab, our other two fab can do 3x of what they're producing today.\n\nSo I have no concern about the upside. I have the concern on the downside because, for four or five quarters, we've been calling it a bottom and we're probably still dribbling at the bottom. And the current quarter is down, what, 12% from last quarter sequentially. And the inventory has been growing. Every quarter, we guide down, and the inventory grows further. So I think that's my concern. The upside is covered. We just want to make sure that through all these actions, we don't build inventory.\n\nToday, there is probably $800 million to $1 billion of excess cash tied up in inventory and CapEx. And if we didn't have that, we probably didn't need to refinance one of our loans. So one of the things we need to do is liberate the cash through inventory, liberate some cash through CapEx and liberate some cash through growth of the business that is likely to come in the coming quarters and, by a combination of all those, get the free cash flow above where our dividend is.\n\nToday, we're borrowing money to pay the dividend. There's no plan to cut the dividend. Dividend is not at risk. We may have to borrow money for a couple of quarters, which we will do. But as we liberate cash and the cash flow becomes higher than the dividend, then we'll take the remaining upside cash and pay back down this loan that we're borrowing right now to pay the dividend.\n\nOnce we have done that and the total debt has gone back to where it was pre-borrowing for dividend, and we have more money left over, then we'll have a conversation what we do with it. But that's not immediately in the next quarter or so.\n\nSo I'm not worried about the upside, but like what sort of recovery you think can happen? What do you want to say about that?\n\nJAMES BJORNHOLT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INC: Well, we know that there is a lot of inventory that is being drained throughout our customer base and their customer base today. I mean we can quantify the piece that's distribution. We've quantified the last three quarters. That's been about $100 million per quarter that distribution sell-out has been in excess of what we're selling in. And we expect something around that again this quarter, and that is with distribution sell-through falling because distribution customers are draining inventory, right?\n\nAnd so that's on a little less than 50% of the business that goes through distribution. Same thing is happening on the direct side, but we don't get any kind of real-time reporting from the customers. So I'm with you that I think this can have a really nice bounce off the bottom but projecting where exactly that bounce takes us to is an impossible thing to do today. We have very limited visibility.\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI: Sure. Got it. And Steve, we do all these scrapes of [disti] websites. And microcontrollers, in particular, are sort of an outlier in terms of the inventory sitting at these [distis]. And it's not just Microchip.\n\nIs there something unique about MCU? I mean, part of it probably was PSP and all the things that you talked about. Yes, there is that lag effect where you were putting product to customers. But how much of sort of what's going on in microcontroller is industry related? And how would you tie that back to the environment for demand across the different end markets?\n\nSTEVE SANGHI: I don't know if there's anything in a microcontroller product compared to any other product that it should have a higher inventory. I can't put my finger on it. But one thing I look at is TI, Silicon Labs, Microchip, NXP, they all had new CEOs in the last business cycle, and they all built a huge amount of microcontroller inventory. I don't know if there is anything else common. I think for all those CEOs, it was the first business cycle. I don't know how else to say it.\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI: Okay. And then can you talk to China? I know this is more of a structural question. China is sort of seen as this melting ice cube, and it's seen as just only a matter of time until everyone in the industry begins to feel the indigenization of what China is trying to do. From your seat, how much do you see the indigenization efforts as a threat to your business in China?\n\nSTEVE SANGHI: So historically, what we have said is China is 18% of our business. And half of that business is selling to multinationals who are doing manufacturing in China, but their product then moves back out to US or Europe or Japan, somewhere. And we didn't think that, that one was at risk because products they're manufacturing for Western will not likely use a local Chinese parts.\n\nThen the other 9% of the business that's remaining, half of that are very complex parts, FPGA, data center parts, high-end Ethernet parts, high-end microcontrollers, well-integrated parts, so which are not the parts that the Chinese are trying to make or copy in all this boutique Chinese industry developing. So if you take all that out, it only leaves about 4%, 5% of the business, which is commodity-like microcontrollers that are going to the Chinese customers, which could be vulnerable to the local Chinese supply.\n\nSo that's really what we have historically said. And it's largely still correct, but I think you're starting to see some chinks in the armor where, for example, European car manufacturers have assembly plans for cars in China, and they're getting government pressure to use local Chinese parts. And here and there, you're starting to see designs pop up. It's not making any significant difference. It'd probably be years before it makes any meaningful difference.\n\nAnd automotive design is three years away from production usually. It's a long cycle. But I think that thing is no longer 0. There are some cracks starting to develop.\n\nAnd then China is applying more and more pressure for the industry to use local parts. Now local companies don't really have a broad enough product line. I have said for years, if you recall this conversation, that usually 70% of microcontroller customers do not go to production with the device they first designed with. A year, 1.5 years, it takes to go to production, usually, the spec changes. Marketing comes in and says, Well, we need to add a color display, black and white is not good enough, USP connectivity was fine, but now we need to connect it to Internet, or the power is too high, we need a low-power part.\n\nSo during the design phase, the spec changes. And when that spec changes, if you're designing with a local Chinese person who has 2 or 3 microcontrollers, you don't find another part that fits in there, which allows you to do what you do. We have 20,000 microcontrollers, distinct microcontrollers; parts with USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, TWMs; low power, high power, high speed, low speed; pin counts, 8 pin, 16 pin, 32 pin, 40 pin, 68 pin. And so when the customer definition changes and he needs a different part, he can preserve his investment in design and firmware and usually find a different part, which has what it needs from a Microchip portfolio. But he can't find that kind of diversity to fit into the same socket from a local Chinese guy who designed two parts.\n\nAnd the second thing is when a Chinese guy designs one or two parts, there is no microcontroller in our portfolio that will make even 0.1% of our business. But 20,000 [mass sets], that make up our business. So it's highly fragmented and that high fragmentation is our friend because you can't attack that kind of fragmentation. You have to produce all these devices. So competition is increasing.\n\nBut hundreds and hundreds of these Chinese companies funded by government are going bankrupt in two, three years, but some of them are prevailing. And the ones who are prevailing are starting to make some small inroads no matter how small they are. They're not affecting the revenue today. It's of the order of less than 1%. But it's an issue in the next 5 years and 10 years.\n\nSo what is needed, and some of our competitors are looking at the same thing, where you need a China for China strategy, where there's a Chinese company that we fund, which is based in Shanghai with a Chinese name, with a Chinese logo. We have actually just trademarked a Chinese Microchip. When you read it, it's in Chinese. But apparently, it says Microchip, I can't tell. And then you sell the [die] to this company and this company locally assembles and tests and markets it with a Chinese data sheet with Chinese engineers, with Chinese management, with a Chinese Managing Director. That's one model. There are versions of the other model. People are talking about it.\n\nSo once you become that, then you're part of the ecosystem with the strength of our 20,000 parts, with the strength of our design capability, marketing muscle, all the app notes and website and on and on and on. So you take your global strength and you apply it with a Chinese frontage and then the locals cannot make a dent, and you participate in the growth of the Chinese business. We're going to land at doing something. I don't know what that form would be. So I think that's the answer there.\n\nJAMES BJORNHOLT: I think some of the challenge, though, is that the rules are ever changing. What works today might not work 12 months from now, right? So you have to be on top of it and not be so dedicated to one approach and then have that approach not work.\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI: As you go through this evaluation, who knows what the new administration will do? But the talk about tariffs and all this kind of stuff, I mean, how does that play into your thinking about what you want to do?\n\nSTEVE SANGHI: So what the tariffs and all that have done is it has stressed relationships with Chinese customers. I was talking to our Head of Applications in China, it was a couple of years ago. And he was complaining that some Chinese customers are saying, US government shut down ZTE. They shut down Huawei. Why should we design with an American product? They could shut us down someday.\n\nSo I said, Well, let's take the example of ZTE. ZTE, they sold parts to Iran in violation of the embargo. Don't you think they should be penalized for that? And his answer was, why does China care? That's a US problem.\n\nYou don't like Iran. They are our friends. And that's the attitude. They say -- hey, we don't have any problem with Iran. So the problem is when we are shutting down those customers, how would our customers in the US feel if China shuts down Cisco over there, like we shut down Huawei? When you think of the reverse of that, it's frightening.\n\nBut one thing China hasn't done so far is they haven't retaliated much at all. I think there was some sort of note this morning that they're going to control germanium or something. But all this time, while we have put sanctions on them and we have put tariffs on them, they haven't retaliated. And if Trump comes in and puts more sanctions and shuts down more companies and things like that happen and the relationship get even worse, and then Chinese start to retaliate, hold rare earth materials, not allow us to sell and all that, then that becomes much more difficult.\n\nBut my take on that is, number one, it's not likely to happen because China and US cannot exist without each other. There's too much dependence on materials and products and others. Neither can Chinese nor US can complete a server or equipment without having some material or parts coming from the other country.\n\nSo I don't really think a self-destruction is likely to happen. Some wisdom will prevail there. And secondly, whatever happens, whatever rules are, our job is to achieve what is achievable better than our competitors. And if you can do that, then that's the best that can be achieved. Today, we are underperforming to our competitors, and that's not acceptable. And I'm here to change that. And whatever happens, if under those circumstances, under those rules, think of it like, I cannot change the flow of the river, but I can navigate the boat, around the boulders and around the waterfalls and achieve the maximum speed and get ahead of the competitors, that's what we need to do.\n\nTIMOTHY ARCURI: Great.

The notes will mature on the maturity date (November 24, 2027) unless they are automatically called on either call observation date (November 28, 2025 and November 20, 2026). The notes will be automatically called on a call observation date if the closing level of the S&P 500® Index (the \"underlier\") on such date is greater than or equal to the initial underlier level of 5,917.11, resulting in a payment on the corresponding call payment date equal to the stated principal amount of the notes plus the product of the stated principal amount and the applicable call premium of 7.40% with respect to the first call observation date and 14.80% with respect to the second call observation date.\n\nIf the notes are not automatically called, the amount that you will be paid on the maturity date is based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the trade date (November 20, 2024) to and including the determination date (November 22, 2027). If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than or equal to the initial underlier level, you will receive the stated principal amount plus the product of the stated principal amount and the greater of (i) the maturity date premium (22.20%) and (ii) the upside participation rate times the underlier return (the percentage increase or decrease in the level of the underlier from the initial underlier level to the final underlier level on the determination date). If the final underlier level declines by up to 20% from the initial underlier level, you will receive the stated principal amount of the notes. However, if the final underlier level is less than 80% of the initial underlier level, the return on the notes will be negative and you may lose up to your entire investment in the notes. In exchange for the potential to receive a call premium or, if the notes are not automatically called, the maturity date premium or upside participation in the appreciation of the underlier at maturity, you must be willing to forgo (i) any return in excess of the applicable call premium if the notes are automatically called, (ii) any dividends paid on the stocks included in the underlier and (iii) interest on the notes.\n\nIf the notes are not automatically called on either call observation date, to determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return. On the maturity date, for each $1,000 stated principal amount note you then hold, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:\n\n· if the underlier return is positive or zero (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 100% of the initial underlier level), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) the greater of (1) the maturity date premium and (2) the upside participation rate of 200% times the underlier return; · if the underlier return is negative but greater than or equal to -20.00% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 80% of the initial underlier level but less than 100% of the initial underlier level), $1,000; or · if the underlier return is negative and below -20.00% (the final underlier level is less than 80% of the initial underlier level), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) the underlier return times (b) $1,000. This amount will be less than $800 and may be zero.\n\nThe notes are unsecured senior debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and guaranteed by Citigroup Inc. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc. If Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc. default on their obligations, you may not receive any amount due under the notes. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and may have limited or no liquidity.\n\nInvesting in the notes involves risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. See \"Summary Risk Factors\" beginning on page PS-6.\n\n            Issue Price(1)   Underwriting Discount(2)   Net Proceeds to Issuer \nPer Note:   $1,000.00        $30.00                     $970.00 \nTotal:      $72,598,000.00   $2,177,940.00              $70,420,060.00 \n\n\n(1) On the date of this pricing supplement, the estimated value of the notes is $969.00 per note, which is less than the issue price. The estimated value of the notes is based on proprietary pricing models of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"CGMI\") and our internal funding rate. It is not an indication of actual profit to CGMI or other of our affiliates, nor is it an indication of the price, if any, at which CGMI or any other person may be willing to buy the notes from you at any time after issuance. See \"Valuation of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\n(2) CGMI, an affiliate of the issuer, is the underwriter for the offering of the notes and is acting as principal. The total underwriting discount in the table above assumes that the underwriter receives an underwriting discount for each note sold in this offering. For more information on the distribution of the notes, see \"Summary Information-Key Terms-Supplemental plan of distribution\" in this pricing supplement. In addition to the underwriting discount, CGMI and its affiliates may profit from hedging activity related to this offering, even if the value of the notes declines. See \"Use of Proceeds and Hedging\" in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the notes or determined that this pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, underlying supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus are truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\n\nThe notes are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\nThe notes are part of the Medium-Term Senior Notes, Series N of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. This pricing supplement is a supplement to the documents listed below and should be read together with such documents, which are available at the following hyperlinks:\n\n· Product Supplement No. EA-02-10 dated March 7, 2023  · Underlying Supplement No. 11 dated March 7, 2023  · Prospectus Supplement and Prospectus each dated March 7, 2023 \n\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc.\n\nPricing Supplement No. 2024-USNCH24557 dated November 20, 2024\n\nThe issue price, underwriting discount and net proceeds listed above relate to the notes we sell initially. We may decide to sell additional notes after the date of this pricing supplement, at issue prices and with underwriting discounts and net proceeds that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in notes will depend in part on the issue price you pay for such notes.\n\nCGMI may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the notes. In addition, CGMI or any other affiliate of Citigroup Inc. may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in a note after its initial sale.\n\nSUMMARY INFORMATION\n\nThe terms of the notes are set forth in the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus, as supplemented by this pricing supplement. The accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus contain important disclosures that are not repeated in this pricing supplement. For example, certain events may occur that could affect your payment at maturity, such as market disruption events and other events affecting the underlier. These events and their consequences are described in the accompanying product supplement in the sections \"Description of the Securities-Consequences of a Market Disruption Event; Postponement of a Valuation Date\" and \"Description of the Securities-Certain Additional Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Index-Discontinuance or Material Modification of an Underlying Index,\" and not in this pricing supplement. The accompanying underlying supplement contains important disclosures regarding the underlier that are not repeated in this pricing supplement. It is important that you read the accompanying product supplement, underlying supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus together with this pricing supplement in connection with your investment in the notes. Certain terms used but not defined in this pricing supplement are defined in the accompanying product supplement. References to \"securities\" in the accompanying product supplement include the notes.\n\nKey Terms\n\nIssuer: Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.\n\nGuarantee: all payments due on the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.\n\nUnderlier: the S&P 500® Index (ticker symbol: \"SPX\"), as maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \"underlier sponsor\"). The underlier is referred to as the \"underlying index\" and the underlier sponsor is referred to as the \"underlying index publisher\" in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nStated principal amount: each note will have a stated principal amount of $1,000; $72,598,000 in the aggregate for all the offered notes\n\nPurchase at amount other than the stated principal amount: the amount we will pay you on a call payment date or at the stated maturity date, as applicable, for the notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to the stated principal amount and hold them to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, as applicable, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the stated principal amount. See \"Summary Risk Factors - If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Stated Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Stated Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.\n\nCash settlement amount (paid on either call payment date): if the notes are automatically called on a call observation date because the closing level of the underlier on such day is greater than or equal to the call level, for each $1,000 stated principal amount of the notes, we will pay you an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of $1,000 times the call premium applicable to the corresponding call observation date.\n\nCash settlement amount (paid on the maturity date): if the notes are not automatically called, on the maturity date, for each $1,000 stated principal amount of notes you then hold, we will pay you an amount in cash equal to:\n\n· if the underlier return is positive or zero (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 100% of the initial underlier level), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) the greater of (1) the maturity date premium and (2) the upside participation rate times the underlier return; · if the underlier return is negative but greater than or equal to -20.00% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 80% of the initial underlier level but less than 100% of the initial underlier level), $1,000; or · if the underlier return is negative and below -20.00% (the final underlier level is less than 80% of the initial underlier level), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) the underlier return times (b) $1,000. This amount will be less than $800 and may be zero.\n\nInitial underlier level: 5,917.11\n\nFinal underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, except in the limited circumstances described under \"Description of the Securities - Certain Additional Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Index - Discontinuance or Material Modification of an Underlying Index\" on page EA-40 of the accompanying product supplement and subject to adjustment as provided under \"Description of the Securities - Certain Additional Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Index - Determining the Closing Level\" on page EA-37 of the accompanying product supplement and \"Description of the Securities - Consequences of a Market Disruption Event; Postponement of a Valuation Date\" beginning on page EA-22 of the accompanying product supplement.\n\nUnderlier return: the quotient of (i) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (ii) the initial underlier level, expressed as a positive or negative percentage\n\nCall observation dates: November 28, 2025 and November 20, 2026. Each call observation date is referred to as a \"valuation date\" in the accompanying product supplement and is subject to postponement if such date is not a scheduled trading day or if certain market disruption events occur, as described under \"Description of the Securities - Consequences of a Market Disruption Event; Postponement of a Valuation Date\" beginning on page EA-22 of the accompanying product supplement.\n\nCall payment dates: the second business day after the corresponding call observation date. If a call observation date is postponed as provided under \"Call observation dates\" above, the corresponding call payment date will also be postponed by the same number of business day(s) from but excluding the originally scheduled call observation date to and including the actual call observation date.\n\nPS-2\n\nCall premium: 7.40% with respect to the first scheduled call observation date and 14.80% with respect to the second scheduled call observation date.\n\nCall level: 100.00% of the initial underlier level with respect to each scheduled call observation date\n\nMaturity date premium: 22.20%\n\nUpside participation rate: 200.00%\n\nTrade date: November 20, 2024. The trade date is referred to as the \"pricing date\" in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nOriginal issue date (settlement date): November 27, 2024. See \"Supplemental plan of distribution\" below for additional information.\n\nDetermination date: November 22, 2027. The determination date is referred to as the \"valuation date\" in the accompanying product supplement and is subject to postponement if such date is not a scheduled trading day or if certain market disruption events occur, as described under \"Description of the Securities - Consequences of a Market Disruption Event; Postponement of a Valuation Date\" beginning on page EA-22 of the accompanying product supplement.\n\nMaturity date: November 24, 2027\n\nNo interest: the notes will not bear interest\n\nNo listing: the notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system\n\nAutomatic redemption: If the closing level of the underlier on either call observation date is greater than or equal to the call level, the notes will be automatically called on the applicable call observation date and we will pay the applicable cash settlement amount on the corresponding call payment date\n\nBusiness day: as described under \"Description of the Securities - General\" on page EA-21 in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nScheduled trading day: as described under \"Description of the Securities - Certain Additional Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Index - Definitions of Market Disruption Event and Scheduled Trading Day and Related Definitions\" beginning on page EA-37 of the accompanying product supplement\n\nSupplemental plan of distribution: Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. expects to sell to CGMI, and CGMI expects to purchase from Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., the aggregate stated principal amount of the offered notes specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement. CGMI proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement and to certain unaffiliated securities dealers at such price less a concession not in excess of 3.00% of the stated principal amount. In addition to the underwriting discount, CGMI and its affiliates may profit from hedging activity related to this offering, even if the value of the notes declines. See \"Use of Proceeds and Hedging\" in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nCGMI is an affiliate of ours. Accordingly, this offering will conform with the requirements addressing conflicts of interest when distributing the securities of an affiliate set forth in Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Client accounts over which Citigroup Inc. or its subsidiaries have investment discretion will not be permitted to purchase the notes, either directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the client.\n\nSecondary market sales of securities typically settle two business days after the date on which the parties agree to the sale. Because the settlement date for the notes is more than two business days after the trade date, investors who wish to sell the notes at any time prior to the second business day preceding the original issue date will be required to specify an alternative settlement date for the secondary market sale to prevent a failed settlement. Investors should consult their own investment advisors in this regard.\n\nSee \"Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"Plan of Distribution\" in each of the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus for additional information.\n\nA portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used to hedge our obligations under the notes. We have hedged our obligations under the notes through CGMI or other of our affiliates, or through a dealer participating in this offering or its affiliates. CGMI or such other of our affiliates or such dealer or its affiliates may profit from this hedging activity even if the value of the notes declines. This hedging activity could affect the closing level of the underlier and, therefore, the value of and your return on the notes. For additional information on the ways in which our counterparties may hedge our obligations under the notes, see \"Use of Proceeds and Hedging\" in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nERISA: as described under \"Benefit Plan Investor Considerations\" beginning on page EA-56 in the accompanying product supplement.\n\nCalculation Agent: CGMI\n\nCUSIP: 173070PP2\n\nISIN: US173070PP20\n\nPS-3\n\nHYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES\n\nThe table and examples below are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that various hypothetical underlier levels on a call observation date and on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount on the stated maturity date or whether the securities are called.\n\nThe table and examples below are based on a range of closing levels for the underlier that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the underlier level will be on any day throughout the life of the notes, and no one can predict what the closing level of the underlier will be on a call observation date or on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past - meaning that the underlier level has changed considerably in relatively short periods - and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period. Investors in the notes will not receive any dividends on the stocks that constitute the underlier. The table and examples below do not show any effect of lost dividend yield over the term of the notes. See \"Summary Risk Factors-Investing in the Notes Is Not Equivalent to Investing in the Underlier or the Stocks that Constitute the Underlier\" below.\n\nThe information in the table and examples below reflects hypothetical returns on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the stated principal amount and held to a call payment date or the maturity date, as applicable. If you sell the notes in a secondary market prior to the maturity date, your return will depend upon the value of the notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table or examples below such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our and Citigroup Inc.'s creditworthiness. Please read \"Summary Risk Factors-The Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity Will Fluctuate Based on Many Unpredictable Factors\" in this pricing supplement. It is likely that any secondary market price for the notes will be less than the issue price.\n\nThe information in the table and examples also reflects the key terms and assumptions in the box below.\n\nKey Terms and Assumptions Stated principal amount $1,000 Call level on each call observation date 100.00% of the initial underlier level Call premium\n\n7.40% for the first call observation date;\n\n14.80% for the second call observation date\n\nMaturity date premium 22.20% Upside participation rate 200.00%\n\nNeither a market disruption event nor a non-scheduled trading day occurs on an originally scheduled call observation date or the originally scheduled determination date\n\nNo change in or affecting any of the stocks comprising the underlier or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier\n\nNotes purchased on original issue date at the stated principal amount and held to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, as applicable\n\nThe actual performance of the underlier over the life of the notes, as well as whether the notes are automatically called on a call observation date and the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical underlier levels shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical levels of the underlier during recent periods, see \"The Underlier - Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier\" below.\n\nIf the notes are automatically called on the first call observation date (i.e., on the first call observation date, the closing level of the underlier is greater than or equal to the call level), the cash settlement amount that we would deliver for each $1,000 stated principal amount of the notes on the applicable call payment date would be the sum of $1,000 plus the product of $1,000 times the call premium of 7.40%. If, for example, the closing level of the underlier on the first call observation date were determined to be 120.000% of the initial underlier level, the notes would be automatically called and the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on the notes on the corresponding call payment date would be 107.40% of the stated principal amount of the notes or $1,074.00 for each $1,000 stated principal amount of the notes. The return on the notes upon automatic call is capped and may be less than the return on a direct investment in the underlier.\n\nIf, for example, the notes are not automatically called on the first call observation date but are automatically called on the second call observation date (i.e., on the first call observation date, the closing level of the underlier is less than the call level and on the second call observation date, the closing level of the underlier is greater than or equal to the call level), the cash settlement amount that we would deliver for each $1,000 stated principal amount of the notes on the applicable call payment date would be the sum of $1,000 plus the product of the $1,000 times the call premium of 14.80%. If, for example, the closing level of the underlier on the second call observation date were determined to be 140.000% of the initial underlier level, the notes would be automatically called and the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on the notes on the corresponding call payment date would be 114.80% of the stated principal amount of the notes or $1,148.00 for each $1,000 stated principal amount of the notes. The return on the notes upon automatic call is capped and may be less than the return on a direct investment in the underlier.\n\nIf the notes are not automatically called on either call observation date (i.e., the closing level of the underlier on each call observation date is less than the call level), the cash settlement amount we would deliver for each $1,000 stated principal amount note on the stated maturity date will depend on the performance of the underlier on the determination date, as shown in the table below. The table below assumes that the notes have not been automatically called on either call observation date and reflects hypothetical cash settlement amounts that you could receive on the stated maturity date.\n\nThe levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (at maturity), based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the stated principal amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash\n\nPS-4\n\nsettlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding stated principal amount of the notes on the maturity date would equal 100.000% of the stated principal amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.\n\nThe Notes Have Not Been Automatically Called\n\nHypothetical Final Underlier Level(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level)   Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount (at Maturity)(as Percentage of Stated Principal Amount) \n200.000%                                                                       300.000% \n175.000%                                                                       250.000% \n150.000%                                                                       200.000% \n125.000%                                                                       150.000% \n111.100%                                                                       122.200% \n110.000%                                                                       122.200% \n105.000%                                                                       122.200% \n100.000%                                                                       122.200% \n90.000%                                                                        100.000% \n80.000%                                                                        100.000% \n75.000%                                                                        75.000% \n50.000%                                                                        50.000% \n25.000%                                                                        25.000% \n0.000%                                                                         0.000% \n                                                                                 \n\n\nIf, for example, the notes have not been automatically called on either call observation date and the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount (at maturity) that we would deliver on the notes at maturity would be 25.000% of the stated principal amount of the notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased the notes on the original issue date at the stated principal amount and held them to the maturity date, you would lose 75.000% of your investment. In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 110.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount (at maturity) that we would deliver on the notes at maturity would be equal to the stated principal amount plus the product of the stated principal amount and the greater of the maturity date premium and the upside participation rate times the underlier return, as shown in the table above.\n\nThe cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on levels of the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date. The actual cash settlement amount you receive on the maturity date may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The actual market value of the notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell the notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on a call payment date or at maturity on notes held to the applicable call payment date or the stated maturity date, as applicable, in the examples above assume you purchased the notes at their stated principal amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for the notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in the notes will be affected by the amount you pay for the notes. If you purchase the notes for a price other than the stated principal amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read \"Summary Risk Factors - The Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity Will Fluctuate Based on Many Unpredictable Factors\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nWe cannot predict the closing level of the underlier on a call observation date or the determination date or what the value of the notes will be on any particular day, nor can we predict the relationship between the underlier level and the value of the notes at any time prior to the maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, on a call payment date or at maturity and the return on the notes will depend on whether the notes are automatically called and the actual final underlier level as determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of the notes, if any, on a call payment date or on the maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and examples above.\n\nPS-5\n\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment in the notes is significantly riskier than an investment in conventional debt securities. The notes are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in our conventional debt securities (guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.), including the risk that we and Citigroup Inc. may default on our obligations under the notes, and are also subject to risks associated with the underlier. Accordingly, the notes are suitable only for investors who are capable of understanding the complexities and risks of the notes. You should consult your own financial, tax and legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in the notes and the suitability of the notes in light of your particular circumstances.\n\nThe following is a summary of certain key risk factors for investors in the notes. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of risks relating to an investment in the notes contained in the section \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" beginning on page EA-7 in the accompanying product supplement. You should also carefully read the risk factors included in the accompanying prospectus supplement and in the documents incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus, including Citigroup Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which describe risks relating to the business of Citigroup Inc. more generally.\n\nYou May Lose Some or All of Your Investment\n\nUnlike conventional debt securities, the notes do not repay a fixed amount of principal at maturity. If the notes are not automatically called on either call observation date, your payment at maturity will depend on the performance of the underlier. If the final underlier level is less than 80% of the initial underlier level, you will receive less than the stated principal amount of the notes at maturity. If the final underlier level is less than 80.00% of the initial underlier level, you will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for each 1% by which the underlier depreciates below the initial underlier level. There is no minimum payment at maturity, and you may lose up to all of your investment.\n\nThe Return on Your Notes May Change Significantly Despite Only a Small Change in the Level of the Underlier Below 80% of the Initial Underlier Level\n\nIf the final underlier level is less than 80% of the initial underlier level, you will receive less than the stated principal amount of your notes and you will lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the notes. This means that while a decrease in the final underlier level to 80% of the initial underlier level will not result in a loss of principal on the notes, a decrease in the final underlier level to less than 80% of the initial underlier level will result in a loss of a significant portion of the stated principal amount of the notes despite only a small change in the level of the underlier.\n\nThe Notes Do Not Pay Interest\n\nUnlike conventional debt securities, the notes do not pay interest. You should not invest in the notes if you seek current income during the term of the notes.\n\nThe Notes Are Subject to Automatic Redemption\n\nIf the notes are automatically called on either call observation date, your potential return on the notes is limited to the applicable call premium on the applicable call payment date. If the closing level of the underlier is greater than or equal to the call level on either call observation date, we will pay you the stated principal amount of the notes along with the call premium applicable to that call observation date, regardless of how significantly the closing level of the underlier on that call observation date may exceed the call level. Accordingly, the call premium may result in a return on the notes that is significantly less than the return you could have achieved on a direct investment in the underlier. In addition, the call premium you receive if the notes are called on either call observation date may be significantly less than the return you could have achieved if the notes had not been automatically called and you had been able to receive the payment at maturity instead.\n\nThe Term of the Notes May Be as Short as Approximately 12 Months\n\nIf the closing level of the underlier on either call observation date, including the call observation date expected to occur approximately 12 months after the trade date, is greater than or equal to the call level, the notes will be automatically called. The earlier the automatic call, the lower the call premium you will receive.\n\nInvesting in the Notes Is Not Equivalent to Investing in the Underlier or the Stocks that Constitute the Underlier\n\nYou will not have voting rights, rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the stocks that constitute the underlier. The payment scenarios described in this pricing supplement do not show any effect of lost dividend yield over the term of the notes.\n\nYour Return on the Notes Depends on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on Only Three Days\n\nBecause your return on the notes depends on the closing levels of the underlier on the call observation dates or the determination date, as applicable, you are subject to the risk that the closing levels of the underlier on those days may be lower, and possibly significantly lower, than on one or more other dates during the term of the notes. If you had invested in another instrument linked to the underlier that you could sell for full value at a time selected by you, or if the payment at maturity were based on an average of closing levels of the underlier, you might have achieved better returns.\n\nThe Notes Are Subject to the Credit Risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc.\n\nIf we default on our obligations under the notes and Citigroup Inc. defaults on its guarantee obligations, you may not receive anything owed to you under the notes.\n\nThe Notes Will Not Be Listed on Any Securities Exchange and You May Not Be Able to Sell Them Prior to Maturity\n\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore, there may be little or no secondary market for the notes. CGMI currently intends to make a secondary market in relation to the notes and to provide an indicative bid price for the notes on a daily\n\nPS-6\n\nbasis. Any indicative bid price for the notes provided by CGMI will be determined in CGMI's sole discretion, taking into account prevailing market conditions and other relevant factors, and will not be a representation by CGMI that the notes can be sold at that price, or at all. CGMI may suspend or terminate making a market and providing indicative bid prices without notice, at any time and for any reason. If CGMI suspends or terminates making a market, there may be no secondary market at all for the notes because it is likely that CGMI will be the only broker-dealer that is willing to buy the notes prior to maturity. Accordingly, an investor must be prepared to hold the notes until maturity.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes on the Trade Date, Based on CGMI's Proprietary Pricing Models and Our Internal Funding Rate, Is Less than the Issue Price\n\nThe difference is attributable to certain costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes that are included in the issue price. These costs include (i) any selling concessions or other fees paid in connection with the offering of the notes, (ii) hedging and other costs incurred by us and our affiliates in connection with the offering of the notes and (iii) the expected profit (which may be more or less than actual profit) to CGMI or other of our affiliates in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes. These costs also include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering. These costs adversely affect the economic terms of the notes because, if they were lower, the economic terms of the notes would be more favorable to you. The economic terms of the notes are also likely to be adversely affected by the use of our internal funding rate, rather than our secondary market rate, to price the notes. See \"The Estimated Value of the Notes Would Be Lower if It Were Calculated Based on Our Secondary Market Rate\" below.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Was Determined for Us by Our Affiliate Using Proprietary Pricing Models\n\nCGMI derived the estimated value disclosed on the cover page of this pricing supplement from its proprietary pricing models. In doing so, it may have made discretionary judgments about the inputs to its models, such as the volatility of the underlier, dividend yields on the stocks that constitute the underlier and interest rates. CGMI's views on these inputs may differ from your or others' views, and as an underwriter in this offering, CGMI's interests may conflict with yours. Both the models and the inputs to the models may prove to be wrong and therefore not an accurate reflection of the value of the notes. Moreover, the estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement may differ from the value that we or our affiliates may determine for the notes for other purposes, including for accounting purposes. You should not invest in the notes because of the estimated value of the notes. Instead, you should be willing to hold the notes to maturity irrespective of the initial estimated value.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Would Be Lower if It Were Calculated Based on Our Secondary Market Rate\n\nThe estimated value of the notes included in this pricing supplement is calculated based on our internal funding rate, which is the rate at which we are willing to borrow funds through the issuance of the notes. Our internal funding rate is generally lower than our secondary market rate, which is the rate that CGMI will use in determining the value of the notes for purposes of any purchases of the notes from you in the secondary market. If the estimated value included in this pricing supplement were based on our secondary market rate, rather than our internal funding rate, it would likely be lower. We determine our internal funding rate based on factors such as the costs associated with the notes, which are generally higher than the costs associated with conventional debt securities, and our liquidity needs and preferences. Our internal funding rate is not an interest rate that we will pay to investors in the notes, which do not bear interest.\n\nBecause there is not an active market for traded instruments referencing our outstanding debt obligations, CGMI determines our secondary market rate based on the market price of traded instruments referencing the debt obligations of Citigroup Inc., our parent company and the guarantor of all payments due on the notes, but subject to adjustments that CGMI makes in its sole discretion. As a result, our secondary market rate is not a market-determined measure of our creditworthiness, but rather reflects the market's perception of our parent company's creditworthiness as adjusted for discretionary factors such as CGMI's preferences with respect to purchasing the notes prior to maturity.\n\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Is Not an Indication of the Price, if Any, at Which CGMI or Any Other Person May Be Willing to Buy the Notes From You in the Secondary Market\n\nAny such secondary market price will fluctuate over the term of the notes based on the market and other factors described in the next risk factor. Moreover, unlike the estimated value included in this pricing supplement, any value of the notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction will be based on our secondary market rate, which will likely result in a lower value for the notes than if our internal funding rate were used. In addition, any secondary market price for the notes will be reduced by a bid-ask spread, which may vary depending on the aggregate stated principal amount of the notes to be purchased in the secondary market transaction, and the expected cost of unwinding related hedging transactions. As a result, it is likely that any secondary market price for the notes will be less than the issue price.\n\nThe Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity Will Fluctuate Based on Many Unpredictable Factors\n\nThe value of the notes prior to maturity will fluctuate based on the level and volatility of the underlier and a number of other factors, including the price and volatility of the stocks that constitute the underlier, the dividend yields on the stocks that constitute the underlier, interest rates generally, the time remaining to maturity and our and Citigroup Inc.'s creditworthiness, as reflected in our secondary market rate. Changes in the level of the underlier may not result in a comparable change in the value of the notes. You should understand that the value of the notes at any time prior to maturity may be significantly less than the issue price.\n\nIf the Level of the Underlier Changes, the Market Value of Your Notes May Not Change in the Same Manner\n\nYour notes may trade quite differently from the performance of the underlier. Changes in the level of the underlier may not result in a comparable change in the market value of your notes. We discuss some of the reasons for this disparity under \"- The Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity Will Fluctuate Based on Many Unpredictable Factors\" above.\n\nPS-7\n\nImmediately Following Issuance, Any Secondary Market Bid Price Provided by CGMI, and the Value That Will Be Indicated on Any Brokerage Account Statements Prepared by CGMI or Its Affiliates, Will Reflect a Temporary Upward Adjustment\n\nThe amount of this temporary upward adjustment will steadily decline to zero over the temporary adjustment period. See \"Valuation of the Notes\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nOur Offering of the Notes Does Not Constitute a Recommendation of the Underlier\n\nThe fact that we are offering the notes does not mean that we believe that investing in an instrument linked to the underlier is likely to achieve favorable returns. In fact, as we are part of a global financial institution, our affiliates may have positions (including short positions) in the stocks that constitute the underlier or in instruments related to the underlier or such stocks and may publish research or express opinions, that in each case are inconsistent with an investment linked to the underlier. These and other activities of our affiliates may affect the level of the underlier in a way that has a negative impact on your interests as a holder of the notes.\n\nThe Level of the Underlier May Be Adversely Affected by Our or Our Affiliates' Hedging and Other Trading Activities\n\nWe have hedged our obligations under the notes through CGMI or other of our affiliates, or through a dealer participating in this offering or its affiliates, who have taken positions directly in the stocks that constitute the underlier and other financial instruments related to the underlier or such stocks and may adjust such positions during the term of the notes. Our affiliates also trade the stocks that constitute the underlier and other financial instruments related to the underlier or such stocks on a regular basis (taking long or short positions or both), for their accounts, for other accounts under their management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers. Any dealer participating in the offering of the notes or its affiliates may engage in similar activities. These activities could affect the level of the underlier in a way that negatively affects the value of the notes. They could also result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates or any dealer or its affiliates while the value of the notes declines. If the dealer from which you purchase notes is to conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that dealer may profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit, if any, will be in addition to the compensation that the dealer receives for the sale of the notes to you. You should be aware that the potential to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the dealer to sell the notes to you in addition to the compensation they would receive for the sale of the notes.\n\nWe and Our Affiliates May Have Economic Interests That Are Adverse to Yours as a Result of Our Affiliates' Business Activities\n\nOur affiliates may currently or from time to time engage in business with the issuers of the stocks that constitute the underlier, including extending loans to, making equity investments in or providing advisory services to such issuers. In the course of this business, we or our affiliates may acquire non-public information about such issuers, which we will not disclose to you. Moreover, if any of our affiliates is or becomes a creditor of any such issuer, they may exercise any remedies against such issuer that are available to them without regard to your interests. Any dealer participating in the offering of the notes or its affiliates may engage in similar activities.\n\nThe Calculation Agent, Which Is an Affiliate of Ours, Will Make Important Determinations With Respect to the Notes\n\nIf certain events occur, such as market disruption events or the discontinuance of the underlier, CGMI, as calculation agent, will be required to make discretionary judgments that could significantly affect your payment at maturity. In making these judgments, the calculation agent's interests as an affiliate of ours could be adverse to your interests as a holder of the notes.\n\nAdjustments to the Underlier May Affect the Value of Your Notes\n\nThe underlier sponsor may add, delete or substitute the stocks that constitute the underlier or make other methodological changes that could affect the level of the underlier. The underlier sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time without regard to your interests as holders of the notes.\n\nWe May Sell an Additional Aggregate Stated Principal Amount of the Notes at a Different Issue Price\n\nAt our sole option, we may decide to sell an additional aggregate stated principal amount of the notes subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement. The issue price of the notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the original issue price you paid as provided on the cover of this pricing supplement.\n\nIf You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Stated Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Stated Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\n\nThe cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the stated principal amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to a call payment date or the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at the stated principal amount. If you purchase the notes at a premium to the stated principal amount and hold them to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the stated principal amount or a discount to the stated principal amount.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Unclear\n\nThere is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts. If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment of the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes might be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, future legislation, Treasury regulations or IRS guidance could adversely affect the U.S. federal tax treatment of the notes, possibly retroactively.\n\nPS-8\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. investor, you should review the discussion of withholding tax issues in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations-Non-U.S. Holders\" below.\n\nYou should read carefully the discussion under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" and \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in this pricing supplement. You should also consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n\nPS-9\n\nTHE UNDERLIER\n\nThe S&P 500® Index consists of common stocks of 500 issuers selected to provide a performance benchmark for the large capitalization segment of the U.S. equity markets. The S&P 500® Index is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. The S&P 500® Index is reported by Bloomberg L.P. under the ticker symbol \"SPX.\"\n\n\"Standard & Poor's,\" \"S&P\" and \"S&P 500®\" are trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC and have been licensed for use by Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates. For more information, see \"Equity Index Descriptions-The S&P U.S. Indices-License Agreement\" in the accompanying underlying supplement.\n\nPlease refer to the section \"Equity Index Descriptions-The S&P U.S. Indices\" in the accompanying underlying supplement for important disclosures regarding the underlier. Additional information is available on the underlier sponsor's website (including information regarding (i) the underlier's top ten constituents and (ii) the underlier's sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference the website or any material it includes in this document. Neither the issuer nor CGMI makes any representation that such publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.\n\nHistorical Closing Levels of the Underlier\n\nThe closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during the period shown below is not an indication that the closing level of the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the life of your notes.\n\nYou should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier will result in your receiving an amount greater than the stated principal amount of your notes on the maturity date or the notes being called on a call observation date.\n\nNeither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the life of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.\n\nThe graph below shows the closing level of the underlier for each day such level was available from January 2, 2019 to November 20, 2024. We obtained the closing levels from Bloomberg L.P., without independent verification.\n\nThe closing level of the underlier on November 20, 2024 was 5,917.11.\n\nPS-10\n\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nYou should read carefully the discussion under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" and \"Risk Factors Relating to the Securities\" in the accompanying product supplement and \"Summary Risk Factors\" in this pricing supplement.\n\nIn the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, which is based on current market conditions, a note should be treated as a prepaid forward contract for U.S. federal income tax purposes. By purchasing a note, you agree (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary) to this treatment. There is uncertainty regarding this treatment, and the IRS or a court might not agree with it.\n\nAssuming this treatment of the notes is respected and subject to the discussion in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement, the following U.S. federal income tax consequences should result under current law:\n\n· You should not recognize taxable income over the term of the notes prior to maturity, other than pursuant to a sale or exchange. · Upon a sale or exchange of a note (including retirement at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the note. Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the note for more than one year.\n\nWe do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the treatment of the notes. An alternative characterization of the notes could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the notes, including the timing and character of income recognized. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have requested comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \"prepaid forward contracts\" and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations or other guidance. Furthermore, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative contracts. Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding possible alternative tax treatments of the notes and potential changes in applicable law.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussions below and in \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement, if you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the accompanying product supplement) of the notes, you generally should not be subject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax in respect of any amount paid to you with respect to the notes, provided that (i) income in respect of the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and (ii) you comply with the applicable certification requirements.\n\nAs discussed under \"United States Federal Tax Considerations-Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\" in the accompanying product supplement, Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (\"Section 871(m)\") generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities (\"U.S. Underlying Equities\") or indices that include U.S. Underlying Equities. Section 871(m) generally applies to instruments that substantially replicate the economic performance of one or more U.S. Underlying Equities, as determined based on tests set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. However, the regulations, as modified by an IRS notice, exempt financial instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a \"delta\" of one. Based on the terms of the notes and representations provided by us, our counsel is of the opinion that the notes should not be treated as transactions that have a \"delta\" of one within the meaning of the regulations with respect to any U.S. Underlying Equity and, therefore, should not be subject to withholding tax under Section 871(m).\n\nA determination that the notes are not subject to Section 871(m) is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this treatment. Moreover, Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including your other transactions. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.\n\nIf withholding tax applies to the notes, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.\n\nYou should read the section entitled \"United States Federal Tax Considerations\" in the accompanying product supplement. The preceding discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.\n\nYou should also consult your tax adviser regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the notes and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n\nPS-11\n\nVALUATION OF THE NOTES\n\nCGMI calculated the estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement based on proprietary pricing models. CGMI's proprietary pricing models generated an estimated value for the notes by estimating the value of a hypothetical package of financial instruments that would replicate the payout on the notes, which consists of a fixed-income bond (the \"bond component\") and one or more derivative instruments underlying the economic terms of the notes (the \"derivative component\"). CGMI calculated the estimated value of the bond component using a discount rate based on our internal funding rate. CGMI calculated the estimated value of the derivative component based on a proprietary derivative-pricing model, which generated a theoretical price for the instruments that constitute the derivative component based on various inputs, including the factors described under \"Summary Risk Factors-The Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity Will Fluctuate Based on Many Unpredictable Factors\" in this pricing supplement, but not including our or Citigroup Inc.'s creditworthiness. These inputs may be market-observable or may be based on assumptions made by CGMI in its discretionary judgment.\n\nFor a period of approximately three months following issuance of the notes, the price, if any, at which CGMI would be willing to buy the notes from investors, and the value that will be indicated for the notes on any brokerage account statements prepared by CGMI or its affiliates (which value CGMI may also publish through one or more financial information vendors), will reflect a temporary upward adjustment from the price or value that would otherwise be determined. This temporary upward adjustment represents a portion of the hedging profit expected to be realized by CGMI or its affiliates over the term of the notes. The amount of this temporary upward adjustment will decline to zero on a straight-line basis over the three-month temporary adjustment period. However, CGMI is not obligated to buy the notes from investors at any time. See \"Summary Risk Factors - The Notes Will Not Be Listed on Any Securities Exchange and You May Not Be Able to Sell Them Prior to Maturity.\"\n\nVALIDITY OF THE NOTES\n\nIn the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special products counsel to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., when the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the indenture, and delivered against payment therefor, such notes and the related guarantee of Citigroup Inc. will be valid and binding obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc., respectively, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above. This opinion is given as of the date of this pricing supplement and is limited to the laws of the State of New York, except that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the application of state securities or Blue Sky laws to the notes.\n\nIn giving this opinion, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has assumed the legal conclusions expressed in the opinions set forth below of Alexia Breuvart, Secretary and General Counsel of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., and Karen Wang, Senior Vice President - Corporate Securities Issuance Legal of Citigroup Inc. In addition, this opinion is subject to the assumptions set forth in the letter of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP dated February 14, 2024, which has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Citigroup Inc. on February 14, 2024, that the indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of, the trustee and that none of the terms of the notes nor the issuance and delivery of the notes and the related guarantee, nor the compliance by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc. with the terms of the notes and the related guarantee respectively, will result in a violation of any provision of any instrument or agreement then binding upon Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. or Citigroup Inc., as applicable, or any restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. or Citigroup Inc., as applicable.\n\nIn the opinion of Alexia Breuvart, Secretary and General Counsel of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., (i) the terms of the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been duly established under the indenture and the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. has duly authorized the issuance and sale of such notes and such authorization has not been modified or rescinded; (ii) Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York; (iii) the indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.; and (iv) the execution and delivery of such indenture and of the notes offered by this pricing supplement by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., and the performance by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. of its obligations thereunder, are within its corporate powers and do not contravene its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents. This opinion is given as of the date of this pricing supplement and is limited to the laws of the State of New York.\n\nAlexia Breuvart, or other internal attorneys with whom she has consulted, has examined and is familiar with originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to her satisfaction, of such corporate records of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., certificates or documents as she has deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed above.

         "As per the economic survey, the Ports and Shipping, Civil Aviation and Railways sectors were the three infrastructure sectors with the most capital expenditure (capex) allocated in the budget. Till November 2024, they have utilised 76 per cent, 69 per cent and 67 per cent of the allocated budgeted capex. The capex saw an uptick in the July-November period, after the conclusion of the General Election 2024.\n\nAs per media reports, Railways capital expenditure (capex) is expected to rise by 20 per cent in the FY26 budget. This could raise capex for FY26 to more than Rs 3 trillion, from Rs 2.65 trillion provided in the FY25. As per estimates from the Indian Railways, nearly 80 per cent of Rs 2.65 trillion has been spent till now, and it expects the balance to be spent in the remaining fiscal year.\n\nThe higher allocation would be incurred on laying new tracks, upgrading existing ones and buying rolling stock - locomotives, wagons and coaches. The railways will also start Vande Bharat sleeper trains that will have improved comfort for passengers over long journeys. The National High Speed Rail Corp had received Rs 21,000 crore in FY25 and is expected to receive higher allocation for faster infrastructure development on this crucial corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, the railways is the largest consumer of wagons in the country. The outlook for the wagon industry mainly depends on demand and budgeted allocation for such outlays. The Government of India is focusing on improving railway infrastructure and ensuring faster development and completion of tracks, rail electrification, rolling stock manufacturing and delivering passenger freight services, according to CARE Ratings.\n\nAnalysts at Elara Capital expect a pick-up in inflows in Q4FY25 set against a slow start to capex spending in FY25, given elections-led delays (76 per cent of gross budgetary support spent as on 5 January 2025). Order momentum may pick-up further in FY26, led by new offerings in rolling stock, along with opportunities worth Rs 4.5 trillion in network expansion, and a large pipeline for the rollout of Kavach (Rs 45,000 crore opportunities) systems.\n\nSince the past three years, the Indian Railways has mostly underspent its budgetary allocation for rolling stock – by 4 per cent in FY22 and 26 per cent in FY23. In FY24, it exceeded its budgetary allocation by 7 per cent, led by heightened focus on increasing the pace of project commissioning, likely ahead of the elections in FY25. However, as FY25 was the year that held elections for the center and various states, it witnessed a slowdown in approvals and project allocations.\n\nPer a Press Information Bureau (PIB) release by the Ministry of Railways, as on 5 January, around Rs 40,400 crore was spent, at just 79 per cent of the budgetary allocation for rolling stock. However, the pace of activity is expected to pick up in FY26, with various projects being fast tracked and many new initiatives underway to improve the railway experience for customers, the brokerage firm said in a sector update note.",

         "Seizing the affluent boom\n\nThe mass and upper-affluent segments, now the fastest-growing spenders, drove double-digit growth in credit card spending in 2024, according to Standard Chartered.\n\nTravel remains a leading category in spending, according to Citi, noting double digit growth in cross-border spend compared to pre-Covid.\n\nThis has prompted banks to sharpen their focus on premium credit cards, which offer a blend of luxury perks, travel benefits, and lifestyle privileges tailored to high-income earners.\n\n‘Cards can help with both customer acquisition and retention,’ said Morningstar senior equity analyst Michael Makdad. ‘They are a way for Asian bank-subsidiary wealth managers to deepen their brand and differentiate themselves from rivals such as Swiss banks that don’t have their own premium cards.’\n\nFor instance, Standard Chartered recently launched its Beyond Credit Card in Singapore, luring affluent customers with business-class flight upgrades and Michelin-starred dining.\n\nSimilarly, HSBC designed its first premium credit card, Privé, for private banking clients last October in Hong Kong and India, and is set to launch in Singapore.\n\nWealth management meets premium cards\n\nBanks are increasingly weaving credit cards into wealth management strategies. DBS Hong Kong uses its credit card as a customer acquisition tool for new-to-bank affluent segment and a data engine.\n\nEmily Ip, head of cards and unsecured lending at DBS Bank (Hong Kong), observed a rise in assets under management and investment and insurance product uptake among cardholders, noting of the immense cross-sell potential.\n\n‘Wealth management has been somewhat more of a driver for DBS and Standard Chartered, followed by HSBC and OCBC. For UOB, credit card revenue is more important, and wealth management has been less of a driver,’ Makdad noted.\n\nOCBC’s VOYAGE series saw a 10% jump in accounts last year, while Citi noted double digit growth for its affluent card portfolio.\n\nUOB, meanwhile, reported a 120% spike in mass affluent card applications in Singapore since 2022, fueled by partnerships like its Taylor Swift Eras Tour tie-up. Card applications from high net worth individuals in Singapore saw almost 30% year on year growth in 2024.\n\nUOB head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan noted that mass affluent cardholders are a larger proportion of their cardholder base and contribute to more total card fees, but private banking cardholders have significantly higher per card spend.\n\nAs of 3Q2024, credit card fees contributed about 16% of UOB’s total net fee income.\n\nConcierge at your service\n\nThe race to capture the mass affluent segment has turned concierge teams into unique differentiators.\n\nDBS Insignia, for instance, has a concierge team that handles everything from restaurant reservations to wedding planning. Their clients have even using concierges to plan weddings—and inviting staff to the event too.\n\nHSBC Privé cardholders get priority concert bookings, as does OCBC’s service in securing hard-to-get concert tickets.\n\nApart from gifting bouquets overseas and reserving Michelin restaurants, UOB’s concierge has fulfilled a request to source sold-out Chanel ballerina shoes from the UK and delivered a passport from Berlin to Frankfurt within 24 hours.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs banks look to 2025, the focus will be on expanding and refining their premium card offerings. Standard Chartered plans to roll out the Beyond Credit Card in additional markets, while DBS Hong Kong has set a double digit target for customer acquisition to grow its credit card portfolio.\n\nUOB’s Tan noted that enhancing lifestyle propositions, including more priority access to customers for entertainment acts, underpins their strategy of growing the retail customer base towards their ten million ambition, up from over 8.5m regionally now.\n\n‘Proprietary credit card offerings are a “nice to have” rather than “absolutely must have” item for wealth management business,’ Makdad noted.\n\nMakdad added that ‘clients ultimately decide mostly based on factors other than cards, such as the personal relationship with the individual private banker and access to specialised investment products’, though premium cards help banks stand out in a crowded market.",

The reduction in the number of shares and the increase in share price may result in a decrease in trading volume, which could, in turn, reduce stock price volatility.\n\nIn this regard, the calculation to change a par value of the shares from 5.00 Baht per share to 25.00 Baht per share will result in certain shareholders having fractional shares that are insufficient to convert into new shares. These fractional shares will be discarded in the calculation. For the calculation of the change in a par value of shares and the rounding of fractional shares, the Company will assign Thailand Securities Depository Company Limited (\"TSD\"), which is a share registrar of the Company, to carry out the calculation based on the operational system of the TSD.\n\nNonetheless, in order to protect the rights of shareholders affected by the rounding of fractional shares, shareholders may buy or sell fractional shares (odd lot) on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (\"SET\") to ensure that they have a sufficient number of shares for the share combining calculation before the change in the par value of shares of the Company becomes effective. However, for shareholders who have insufficient fractional shares to convert into new shares, which will be discarded after the calculation, the Company is willing to compensate for the fractional shares that are discarded at a price of\n\n5.00 Baht per share (Equivalent to the original par value of the Company). Each affected shareholder can claim the compensation for the fractional shares through the following procedures:\n\n* Request cash compensation for fractional shares in person at the Company's office, at Cho Thavee Public Company Limited No. 265 Moo 4 Klang Muang Road, Muangkhao Sub-district, Muang Khon Kaen District, Khon Kaen Province 40000 or\n\n* Notify the intention to request compensation for the fractional shares via bank transfer by submitting a written request to the Company through postal mail or by electronic mail (E-mail) to the Company at Cho Thavee Public Company Limited, office No. 265 Moo 4 Klang Muang Road, Muangkhao Sub-district, Muang Khon Kaen District, Khon Kaen Province 40000.

Tahiliani joins the likes of Christian Louboutin, Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren, who have designed uniforms for Olympic athletes.Representatives of the athletes said queries from brands seeking tactical or long-term campaigns have surged from two or three per top name before Tokyo, to at least a dozen now.Executives said they expect the sport stars to exceed India's highest Olympic medal haul of seven in Tokyo. \"We are confident our athletes will do better than the previous Olympics,\" said Jayen Mehta, managing director of dairy major Amul, one of the event sponsors. \"Apart from the sponsorship, we plan to establish a grassroot connect with athletes, since many of the top performers come from smaller towns.\"Big ScoresAn executive at a media buying company said the fee charged by the athletes for endorsements has doubled since Tokyo. \"Rates for short video reels have surged to Rs 2-6 lakh, depending on the athletes,\" he said.Puma will provide over 40 Indian athletes with footwear and accessories and has roped in badminton player PV Sindhu, hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh and javelin thrower Kishore Jena, said Karthik Balagopalan, managing director of the India unit of German sports footwear and apparel maker, which is the team's official footwear partner for the Paris Olympics.Reliance Foundation has signed sports tech company Dream Sports as principal partner for India House. Dream Sports' portfolio of brands such as Dream11, FanCode and DreamSetGo, will be involved with the Olympics at different stages. \"We aim to make premium sporting events and experiences more accessible, and this association allows us to bring the multi-sport event to the Indian market,\" said Monish Shah, founder of DreamSetGo.The event will be the third Olympics that JSW is involved with, said Prashant Rao, executive vice-president, brand, at the group.Vishakha Mulye, chief executive of Aditya Birla Capital, said the official sponsor of Team India is showing support through marketing campaigns across print, digital, OTT platforms, outdoor and social media. The financial services company plans to showcase the athletes' individual stories of struggle and how they overcame them.The Paris Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11. India's team has 117 members.\n\nFor Reprint Rights: timescontent.com",

         "Fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 is considering filing for bankruptcy after exiting its last chapter 11 roughly five years ago, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company, with over 500 stores, is working with restructuring adviser BRG to assess possible paths to address its financial challenges, the people said. The company is also trying to find a buyer that could help the chain avoid bankruptcy, one of them said.\n\nMall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Corporation teamed up with brand licensing company Authentic Brands Group to buy Forever 21 out of bankruptcy in 2020, saving the chain from liquidation.\n\nOwners of the Forever 21 chain in the U.S. announced last month that they are exploring strategic options for its operations. The retailer has faced fierce competition from China-founded online discount retailers Shein and Temu.\n\nIn a bankruptcy, the risk that Forever 21 would liquidate and shut down is high, as it is for most retailers.\n\nForever 21 was among a handful of struggling apparel retailers including JCPenney, Brooks Brothers and Aéropostale that the two mall owners and Authentic Brands teamed up to acquire in recent years.\n\nForever 21 struck a partnership with Shein in 2023, but the deal has been only a moderate success, Authentic Brands Chief Executive Jamie Salter said at a conference a year ago, according to media reports.\n\nThe deal allowed Forever 21 to sell its merchandise on Shein's website, and Shein took a stake in the SPARC joint venture between Authentic Brands and Simon Property, which operates retailers including Forever 21.\n\nIn a reorganization announced last month, the owners of SPARC combined all of the retail operations of Aéropostale, Nautica, Lucky Brand, Brooks Brothers and Eddie Bauer with JCPenney, forming a new company called Catalyst Brands. Catalyst simultaneously said it is exploring strategic options for the Forever 21 stores in the U.S. That review doesn't include the Forever 21 brand and intellectual property, which are owned by Authentic Brands, or stores outside the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA spokesperson for Forever 21 reiterated that the company's owners are exploring a range of strategic options for the retailer's operations and said that they are working diligently to achieve the best possible outcome.\n\nBRG declined to comment.\n\nWrite to Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com, Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com and Jodi Xu Klein at jodi.klein@wsj.com",

         "Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-09 October 2024:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed Prudential plc's Long- Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of the rating actions is below.\n\nThe affirmation reflects Prudential's 'Very Strong' capitalisation with low financial leverage, resilient operating profit and 'Most Favourable' company profile, partially offset by lower investment return and its surplus exposure to equity securities.\n\nFitch maintains a view on the credit profile of Prudential's subsidiary, Prudential Corporation Asia Limited, as we consider it to be a core operating entity under our group rating methodology.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nSustained Robust Capital Position: Prudential is strongly capitalised, with an 'Extremely Strong' Fitch Prism Global Model score at end-2023 and end-1H24. The Prism score fully allows for the group's contractual service margin (CSM) net of tax as part of available capital. We expect its proven capability in free surplus generation to provide capital buffer for organic business expansion and against the negative impact of its USD2 billion two-year share buyback programme. The group repurchased the first tranche of USD192 million shares in August 2024, and expects to buy back USD700 million by end-2024.\n\nThe shareholder group-wide supervision cover ratio on a prescribed capital requirement basis remained strong at 282% at end-1H24, compared with 295% at end-2023. The reduction reflects the net impact of underlying capital generation offset by investment in new business, the payment of the 2023 second interim dividend, and non-operating effects including market volatilities.\n\nLow Leverage Metrics: The capital quality is favourable, with its very low leverage metrics, including the financial leverage ratio at 9.5% at end-1H24 (end-2023: 9.3%). We expect the near-term ratio to remain commensurate with the rating, considering Prudential has no material refinancing plan, its satisfactory CSM accumulation and the effect of the share buyback.\n\nLower Investment Return Weakened Profitability: Prudential's financial performance reflects its sustained underlying profit but is challenged by financial market risks. Profit after tax in 1H24 fell to USD182 million, from USD924 million a year earlier, due to greater market volatility driven by interest rate movements in some APAC markets. Return on equity (ROE) was 0.7% for the six months to June 2024 (2023: 9.8%).\n\nIts value-driven strategy and diversified earning will continue to support CSM generation, and insurance profit growth as a result. Annualised premium equivalent sales rose by 6% yoy in 1H24 and adjusted operating profit was up 9% (2023: 8%), on a constant exchange rate basis, supported by stable release of CSM. New business profit rose by 8% yoy in 1H24, excluding the effects of interest rates changes and other economic effects, on growth in health and protection and saving products via bancassurance. The new business margin was 47% in 1H24 (1H23: 49%) and averaged 54% in 2021-2023.\n\nSurplus Exposure to Equity Securities: The adjusted risky-asset ratio was 69% at end-1H24, up from 64% at end-2023. Equity investments are largely held by the with-profit business in Asia, exposing Prudential's financial performance to volatile equity markets. A segregated surplus has been built up over years to smooth volatility in investment returns, absorbing part of the performance downturn on asset price reductions and easing the pressure on the group's shareholders' equity in an unfavourable macro environment.\n\nWell-Established Brand: We assess Prudential's business profile as 'Most Favourable' and corporate governance as 'Neutral', compared with that of other life insurers in Hong Kong. The ranking is driven by its large operating scale, strong franchise and diversification across product offerings and geographies with a leading position in its core Asian markets. The group maintains multi-channel distribution at scale through productive agency, strategic bancassurance partnership and digital channel.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n- A sustained decline in profitability, including ROE below 8% or a notable decline in new business profit;\n\n- A deterioration in capital position, with the Prism score falling below 'Very Strong' category;\n\n- A material, continuous increase in the adjusted risky-asset ratio.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\n- A significant improvement in financial performance, including ROE above 11%, for a prolonged period;\n\n- A substantial improvement in the industry profiles and operating environments of the markets in which the group operates.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit\n\n9 Oct 2024 05:19 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms Prudential plc's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nreports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.\n\nThe information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.\n\nFor Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001\n\nFitch Ratings, Inc. is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the \"NRSRO\"). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory ), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the \"non-NRSROs\") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2024 05:19 ET (09:19 GMT)",
