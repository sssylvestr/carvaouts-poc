(A-/Stable/F1, A deposit rating) as the cash reserves held at this entity represent the only source of structural CE for these notes and the sudden loss of these funds would imply a downgrade of 10 or more notches. The rating cap reflects the excessive counterparty dependence on the TAB holding the cash reserves, in accordance with Fitch's counterparty criteria.",

In fact, the BOC revised down the amount of slack, or \"modest excess supply\" it believes is in the economy. The output gap estimate goes from -0.75% to -1.75% to -0.25% to -1.25%. Macklem adds the tariff threat weighed on senior officials during rate-policy deliberations, and that reinforced the BOC's decision to cut further. \"The more we can get the economy on a solid footing before it faces new tariffs, the better,\" Macklem says.

This uptick preceded Amazon's new policy requiring employees to work in-office five days a week starting January 2025, up from three days. Previously, rents peaked at nearly $2,500 before the 2020 pandemic, dropping to $1,399 by February 2021 as remote work became prevalent. Post-reopening, demand pushed rents up to $3,118 by August 2022, but they've since fallen by 36% due to increased apartment construction. While longer commutes suggest an impact from Amazon's policy, Redfin says it is premature to link this directly to the rent increase, considering many workers already live close to downtown.

The larger deficit reflects a $10.8 billion rise in goods imports and a $7.8 billion decline in goods exports. Higher imports likely reflect U.S. companies' efforts to ramp up trade at the end of 2024 to get ahead of potential Trump administration tariffs. Most of the rise in imports came in the industrial-supplies category, imports of which grew to $67.05 billion in December, from $56.41 billion a month earlier. The Commerce Department report also showed small declines in wholesale and retail inventories in December versus November.

    "1. MUST IDENTIFY AS CARVE-OUT PROSPECT:\n",
    "   - Company signals intention to divest specific business units or segments\n",
    "   - Company announces strategic refocusing that implies non-core units could be sold\n",
    "   - New strategic plans mentioning focus on specific segments (implying others might be divested)\n",
    "   - Language about simplifying corporate structure or streamlining operations\n",
    "   - References to non-core assets, underperforming units, or subscale operations\n",
    "   - Management discussing 'evaluating options' for specific business segments\n",

    "   - Private equity firms exiting investments (not corporate carve-outs)\n",
    "   - IPO plans without specific business unit divestiture\n",

    "   - Explicit focus on 'core businesses' or 'key segments'\n",
