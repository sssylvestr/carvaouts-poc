         "Impending fintech consolidation could yield unprecedented exit values, says Artis Partners; Acquisitions have already become the norm in the payments space, with the wider sector now set to follow suit",
         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 â an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Eliteâs acquisition of Tranch and Neonomicsâ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",

         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: âAn M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. Weâre already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\nâThe key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers â sometimes direct rivals â in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\nâMany of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\nâAs a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months. If founders arenât considering a strategic exit, they could miss out on a prime opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market, and risk losing ground to rivals who stand to benefit from a larger pool of resources through acquisition.â\n\nBasta concluded: âPursuing the funding route will only dilute ownership stakes and reduce overall profitability when the time eventually comes to sell; even more so today since the fundraising market has not come back nearly as strongly as M&A. Itâs time for fintechs to begin the exit planning phase to ensure they remain competitive and take advantage of the industryâs significant momentum.â\n\n-ENDS-\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout Artis Partners\n\nArtis Partners is a boutique investment bank specialising in strategic M&A and fundraising, delivering high exit values for growth stage European and US technology companies.

         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million. To which are added what would have been accrued for the interest rate of 15.6% of the capital owed, \"payable in six installments, of which only one was paid\".",

         "This is its second completed acquisition in two months. Finli said it is on target to complete further deals this month across Kent, Cardiff, Merseyside and Somerset, feeding directly into three of its core regions.\n\nThe firm, which has four regions in total and offices across England, Scotland and Wales, is looking to grow its local presence in Scotland, the north of England, central England and southern regions.\n\nIn January last year, Finli snapped up Scottish IFA Clark Gillone following its previous purchases of Beaufort Group and Gale and Phillipson.\n\nIt aims to add Â£1bn in assets annually and said it is open to speaking to adviser firms of all sizes from Â£25m under advice.\n\nFinli acquisitions director Jon Barham said: \"Acquiring firms often talk about the ideal size of a firm looking to sell.\n\n\"For us, it's about the ideal attitude. If you want to do right by your clients, then we want to talk to you!\"\n\nFinancial planners rank the reputation of acquiring firm above what they'll pay\n\nA recent poll conducted by Finli showed financial planners give greater consideration to the reputation of potential acquirers than they do the sum they are prepared to pay for their business - with 93% strongly agreeing with the statement \"it is paramount that the firm I sell to has a good reputation compared to just 47 per cent who strongly agree with the statement that it is paramount that I am paid a good price\".\n\nFinli said that it is \"never just about the money\" and that there are emotional considerations that need to be given due thought when taking on another financial planner's clients.\n\nThe recently rebranded national said that the narrative around acquiring books of business is \"all too often exclusively focused on the onboarding mechanics and the numbers â the size of each tranche that is to be seeded across each month\".\n\nThe firm asked financial planners what their aspirations were for themselves and their clients when they come to retire.\n\nSome 78% strongly agreed that it is paramount to know that they made a difference in their clients' lives,15% strongly agreed that it is paramount that they can retain a non-advisory relationship with their clients (with a further 32% somewhat agreeing), 95% strongly agree that they want their clients to know the firm they've chosen to take over from them is their parting good 'advice', and 100% strongly agree that they want their clients to feel listened to, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, 80% strongly agree (and 18% somewhat agree) that it is important that the firm that takes over is culturally aligned with their values and those of their clients.\n\n\"Of course, financial planners want to get a good price for their business. And so they should. However, these are businesses that have been built on nurturing relationships, some spanning several decades. So, it should come as no surprise that financial planners place so much importance on the acquiring firm having a good reputation for looking after clients â even that it Top Trumps the sale price,\" said Finli group chief distribution officer Simon Goldthorpe.\n\nGoldthorpe added: \"Of course, they can have both when it's the right fit! However, understanding and, importantly, appreciating that any deal is as much about emotions as it is about the headline figure and the mechanics of the sale is in everyone's best interests. These findings act as a timely reminder of the need to place equal weighting on both.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: âThe increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

A figure far higher than the one marked in 2023, when 549 deals were mapped (see here BeBeez's Private Equity 2023 Report), in line with the 552 deals in 2022 (see here BeBeez's Private Equity 2022 Report). This is calculated by BeBeez Private Data, BeBeez's private capital database, taking into account both investment and divestment activity and considering not only deals announced by funds, but also those organized by club deals of private investors and investment holding companies. The figure indicates a level of activity never reached since BeBeez began mapping the market.\n\nThat said, only for just under 100 deals was it possible to derive the enterprise value of the target company, accounting for 16.9 percent of total investments and divestments. Among these deals, however, there are some that are very large for the Italian market. Specifically, there are 14 deals (vs. 10 deals in 2023 and 12 in 2022) on companies with EVs greater than EUR 1 billion that involved equity stakes of at least 15 percent and another 13 deals (vs. 8 deals in 2023 and 2022) on companies with EVs of at least EUR 500 million, again for stakes of at least 15 percent.\n\nClick here below to download the report and all the tables mapping deals and investors\n\nReport-PE-EN-2024Download",

         "\"People are scared of losing their jobs,\" Flower explained.\n\nThe Flower Group was launched in July 2023 to support the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process for the wealth management sector. Last month (24 January), it unveiled its M&A support service for the wealth management sector, said to \"reduce transaction timelines by an average of six weeks\".\n\nFor those looking to acquire businesses, Flower suggested considering \"good client data\". \"Acquirers like to hear that a business cares about its clients, such as when someone remembers the small things about their clients, rather than viewing their clients as numbers,\" he noted. \"Listening skills are very important in this space.\"\n\nHe added: \"When you're looking to acquire a business, you need to think to yourself, âCan I see this business fit in with us?'\"\n\nFlower noted that many business owners fear losing value during acquisitions. \"They ask themselves, âIs this going to reduce my value?'\" he said.\n\nTo alleviate such concerns, The Flower Group helps prepare sellers for the demands of due diligence and supports acquirers with key insights into the cultural and operational dynamics of their targets.\n\nEnsuring cultural fit and human capital stability\n\nHoxton Wealth founder and CEO Chris Ball highlighted the importance of understanding whether the human capital within the business will remain post-acquisition.\n\n\"Are you buying someone's book that's retiring? If so, then it's important that if they're saying they're retiring, they actually retire,\" Ball explained. \"If they don't have a real reason for retiring, they may find it too difficult and emotional to leave and could return, which creates challenges.\"\n\nHe also stressed the importance of evaluating existing employees before completing the acquisition.\n\n\"If you're keeping the human capital, it's important to meet those people before you buy the business. You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their âbaby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this â often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to Â£3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locationsâsuch as whether employees will work remotely or in an officeâneed to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open â being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation â leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach â communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration â it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being âdone to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer â ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "Aktia Bank Plcâs Board of Directors has approved the company's updated strategy with new long-term financial targets and an updated dividend policy. An acceleration programme is being launched to drive the implementation of the strategic plan focusing on organic growth in wealth management.\n\nThe core of Aktia's growth strategy is to accelerate our journey towards becoming a unique, leading wealth manager empowered by a strong banking heritage. Aktia has a strong customer base and high customer satisfaction in the core segments, Premium and Private Banking, demonstrating the value of our personalised advisory services and product quality.\n\nDuring the strategic plan period 2025â2029, we will strengthen our focus on the strategic customer segments Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutions. In these customer segments, we aim for growth and an excellent customer experience. Efficiency and outstanding processes are ensured, for example, through investments in digital development. Aktia stands out by high-quality, personal, and attentive service and comprehensive financial solutions offered to a growing customer base.\n\nProgramme for accelerated strategy implementation\n\nAn acceleration programme is launched to strengthen the implementation of the revised strategic plan and strategic priorities. The objective of the programme is to generate comparable operating profit annualised run rate improvements of approximately EUR 7 million by the end of 2025, and a total of approximately EUR 20 million by the end of 2026 â aligned with, Aktiaâs new long-term financial targets. The programme is expected to generate one-off costs, which do not affect the comparable operating result, of approximately EUR 6 million in 2025. The costs relate mainly to external advisory services and are dependent on the financial performance of the programme.\n\nâOur three strategic priorities are active wealth management, growth in our core segments and a first-class customer experience â enabled by investments in digital development, streamlining our business processes, and developing the Aktia way of working. A cornerstone of our revised strategic plan is to increase the availability of personal service and wealth management solutions for a wider customer base. We intend to go beyond the established segment borders in the market and democratise private banking services. In this way, we want to give more customers the opportunity to benefit from our award-winning asset management, our peak competence in wealth management and our unique customer experience. With a robust financial basis, a unique market position, skilled employees and an ambitious leadership team, we are well equipped to deliver results and drive profitable growth. I strongly believe in our ability to achieve our new financial targets, especially with the acceleration programme now launched to implement our strategic plan,â says Aleksi Lehtonen, CEO of Aktia.\n\nAktiaâs strategic priorities are:\n\n1. Active Wealth Management\n\nAs wealth transitions across generations, customers need accessible, sustainable financial solutions. Aktia helps customers grow and transfer wealth with clear, long-term plans and a holistic approach.\n\n2. Winning in Strategic Segments\n\nFinlandâs growth relies on bold investments, cross-generational legacies and work, and thriving communities. Aktia takes an active role by driving success in Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutional segments.\n\n3. The Aktia Experience\n\nWe will stand out by specialising in attentive personal service for a growing customer base and by bringing them the Aktia experience. Skilled and committed employees work together to deliver tailored solutions and to respond to the customersâ financial needs and goals.\n\nKey enabler: Powered by Data and Technologyâ\n\nEnhancing our IT setup to enable growth in a scalable and efficient way.\n\nLong-term financial targets for 2029:\n\n* Comparable return on equity (ROE) over 15 per cent by 2029\n\n* Assets under management over EUR 25 billion* by 2029\n\n* Organic net commission income growth over 5 per cent per year\n\n* Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio 2â4 percentage points above the regulatory requirement.\n\n* This figure reflects gross AuM, corresponding to all AuM in the asset management business for which Aktia receives fee commissions. In the future, Aktia will report both gross and net AuM, rather than only net.\n\nUpdated dividend policy:\n\nAktiaâs goal is to offer its shareholders a competitive total return, including dividends, the amount of which depends on the Group's profit development as well as growth and investment needs. In addition, Aktia wants to ensure sufficient capital adequacy in changing market circumstances. Aktia's capital and dividend policy has been updated.\n\nUpdated dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, excess capital may be distributed to shareholders using e.g. extra dividends or share buy-backs.\n\n(Previous dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay out a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.)\n\nInvestor Event 27 February 2025:\n\nAktia invites investors, analysts and media representatives to an investor event on 27 February 2025 at 12:30 p.m. During the investor event, CEO Aleksi Lehtonen, together with other members of Aktia's Executive Committee, will present the company's updated strategic priorities and an overview of the acceleration programme for the implementation of the strategic plan with new financial targets.

         "27 February 2025 at 1.00 a.m.\n\nAktia launches an acceleration programme to implement its revised strategic plan with new long-term financial targets and updates its dividend policy\n\nAktia Bank Plc's Board of Directors has approved the company's updated strategy with new long-term financial targets and an updated dividend policy. An acceleration programme is being launched to drive the implementation of the strategic plan focusing on organic growth in wealth management.\n\nThe core of Aktia's growth strategy is to accelerate our journey towards becoming a unique, leading wealth manager empowered by a strong banking heritage. Aktia has a strong customer base and high customer satisfaction in the core segments, Premium and Private Banking, demonstrating the value of our personalised advisory services and product quality.\n\nDuring the strategic plan period 2025--2029, we will strengthen our focus on the strategic customer segments Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutions. In these customer segments, we aim for growth and an excellent customer experience. Efficiency and outstanding processes are ensured, for example, through investments in digital development. Aktia stands out by high-quality, personal, and attentive service and comprehensive financial solutions offered to a growing customer base.\n\nProgramme for accelerated strategy implementation\n\nAn acceleration programme is launched to strengthen the implementation of the revised strategic plan and strategic priorities. The objective of the programme is to generate comparable operating profit annualised run rate improvements of approximately EUR 7 million by the end of 2025, and a total of approximately EUR 20 million by the end of 2026 -- aligned with, Aktia's new long-term financial targets. The programme is expected to generate one-off costs, which do not affect the comparable operating result, of approximately EUR 6 million in 2025. The costs relate mainly to external advisory services and are dependent on the financial performance of the programme.\n\n\"Our three strategic priorities are active wealth management, growth in our core segments and a first-class customer experience -- enabled by investments in digital development, streamlining our business processes, and developing the Aktia way of working. A cornerstone of our revised strategic plan is to increase the availability of personal service and wealth management solutions for a wider customer base. We intend to go beyond the established segment borders in the market and democratise private banking services. In this way, we want to give more customers the opportunity to benefit from our award-winning asset management, our peak competence in wealth management and our unique customer experience. With a robust financial basis, a unique market position, skilled employees and an ambitious leadership team, we are well equipped to deliver results and drive profitable growth. I strongly believe in our ability to achieve our new financial targets, especially with the acceleration programme now launched to implement our strategic plan,\" says Aleksi Lehtonen, CEO of Aktia.\n\nAktia's strategic priorities are:\n\n1. Active Wealth Management\n\nAs wealth transitions across generations, customers need accessible, sustainable financial solutions. Aktia helps customers grow and transfer wealth with clear, long-term plans and a holistic approach.\n\n2. Winning in Strategic Segments\n\nFinland's growth relies on bold investments, cross-generational legacies and work, and thriving communities. Aktia takes an active role by driving success in Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutional segments.\n\n3. The Aktia Experience\n\nWe will stand out by specialising in attentive personal service for a growing customer base and by bringing them the Aktia experience. Skilled and committed employees work together to deliver tailored solutions and to respond to the customers' financial needs and goals.\n\nKey enabler: Powered by Data and Technology\n\nEnhancing our IT setup to enable growth in a scalable and efficient way.\n\nLong-term financial targets for 2029: \n\n\n   -- Comparable return on equity (ROE) over 15 per cent by 2029 \n \n   -- Assets under management over EUR 25 billion* by 2029 \n \n   -- Organic net commission income growth over 5 per cent per year \n \n   -- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio 2--4 percentage points above the \n      regulatory requirement. \n\n* This figure reflects gross AuM, corresponding to all AuM in the asset management business for which Aktia receives fee commissions. In the future, Aktia will report both gross and net AuM, rather than only net.\n\nUpdated dividend policy:\n\nAktia's goal is to offer its shareholders a competitive total return, including dividends, the amount of which depends on the Group's profit development as well as growth and investment needs. In addition, Aktia wants to ensure sufficient capital adequacy in changing market circumstances. Aktia's capital and dividend policy has been updated.\n\nUpdated dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, excess capital may be distributed to shareholders using e.g. extra dividends or share buy-backs.\n\n(Previous dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay out a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.)\n\nInvestor Event 27 February 2025:\n\nAktia invites investors, analysts and media representatives to an investor event on 27 February 2025 at 12:30 p.m. During the investor event, CEO Aleksi Lehtonen, together with other members of Aktia's Executive Committee, will present the company's updated strategic priorities and an overview of the acceleration programme for the implementation of the strategic plan with new financial targets.

         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those â¬13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of â¬73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank. The â¬5.65 a share offer â a 5 per cent premium to the market price â was simply the final insult in an investment that has proven catastrophic over the past 14 years.\n\nThose 250 shares that would have been worth â¬17.50 just before the consolidation announcement, and â¬8.75 on the last day the old shares traded on December 18th, became a single share which was worth â¬8.50 at the close of trading on December 21st. However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of â¬6,000 â â¬5,987.50 to be precise â at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way. At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of â¬78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares â shares given in lieu of cash dividends â the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the â¬18.98 a share the bankâs stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the â¬5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. Thatâs 2.26 cent. So your loss on that dayâs trade is almost â¬18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records â or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares â for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, youâll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYouâre talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain â because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price â for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

         "Earl Jarrett, CEO of the Jamaica National Group (JN Group), made the disclosure to staff earlier this week.\n\nâThe JN Financial Group will sign an agreement today for British Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) to purchase its shares in JN General Insurance (JNGI),â Jarrett wrote in a note circulated to staff on Monday. The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms. But those negotiations are continuing,â Levy added.\n\nJNGI will continue to renew motor and property insurance through its branches and brokers as well as honour insurance claims until the sale is finalised.\n\nâOnce the sale is finalised, the JNGI portfolio, business, and locations will be fully managed by BCIC. All positions within JNGI will be made redundant; however, some JNGI employees will be invited to explore opportunities within BCIC,â Jarrettâs e-mail said.\n\nIt noted that JNGI employees and the National Workersâ Union, the bargaining entity that represents the workers, have been kept informed of the planned sale, adding that dialogue is ongoing regarding the future of the employees.\n\nLevy said he didnât know how many of the JNGI staff will be given positions at BCIC.\n\nâWell, a lot of the work weâll be doing once we sign the deal will be around filling out those details. So, at the current time, we donât really know,â Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\nâThe analysis that weâve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,â Levy said. âInsurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I donât think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.â\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCICâs position as one of the leading players in Jamaicaâs general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "During the in-depth analysis of the operation, known as phase two, the CNMC rejected the allegations of 79 associations and only accepted that of Sabadell, considering that it is the only one with a legitimate interest. Two of the organizations that submitted allegations, Foment del Treball and UGT, have filed appeals before the National Court, both of which have been admitted for processing.\n\nThe market test has not yet been launched, but some associations have already been informed that they will be taken into account. By opening the procedure, they will at least have the opportunity to express their opinion during this process on an operation which, they say, limits competition, especially in the SME business, and puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStructural conditions of conductThe market test is being launched after the agreement of commitments between BBVA and the CNMC, in which the behavioral guidelines set out by the opting bank are maintained, mainly related to measures such as maintaining branches except those that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters and commercial conditions for customers for a certain period.\n\nThe CNMC accepts BBVA's approach, although tightening the time commitments, which in some aspects go up to three years. This is a different approach to that advocated by Sabadell, which calls for structural measures and asks that the market test itself should ask the sector whether BBVA should sell assets in order to maintain competition.\n\nOnce the test has been launched, the sector's agents will have ten working days to reply, after which the CNMC's Competition Directorate will submit the final report to the plenary for approval of the opinion.\n\nIt is at that moment when the Ministry of Economy will have 15 days to decide whether to analyze the file and, within 30 additional days, submit it to the Council of Ministers, which may establish additional conditions to BBVA.\n\nBBVA is confident that it will be able to launch the takeover bid in June, although the next few days will be key to determine the speed of the process and whether, given the holiday break, the operation will be postponed until after August.",

The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.\n\nThe entity has been very explicit in recognizing that it wants to grow in markets such as Spain, much more than what banks usually do before carrying out relevant operations. \"We want to grow in larger markets, such as Italy, Spain and Germany,\" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in early February. \"M&A is an option everywhere, if it fits our criteria,\" he added.",

         "Spain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio JuliÃ¡, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena RomÃ¡n as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena RomÃ¡n returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put RomÃ¡n in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique PiÃ±el as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",

         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured âoff balance sheetâ and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from âlimited liability recourseâ meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise, currently not available to the general public.\n\nTax Neutrality: The BVI is tax neutral meaning that there is no income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax levied in the BVI. In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper InformaciÃ³n in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",

         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide. The shareholder is king, just as everyone is king with their own property. When you want to sell your house, it is up to you to decide whether to sell it or not. Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del MediterrÃ¡neo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at TelefÃ³nica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Ãlvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in TelefÃ³nica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the â¬0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of â¬0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate â¬5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents â¬0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa GÃ³mez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, GÃ³mez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

         "Jeffreys told FT Adviser she expected more changes to happen within the M&A market in the coming 12 months - and it would be the acquirers and consolidators themselves who might consolidate.\n\nShe said: âMany PE-backed acquirers took investment in 2019, so the PE houses will be on a countdown to exit their positions, and a wave of transactions is likely.\n\nâThe number of new entrant buyers at that point in time (approximately 15 firms) left many buyers competing over the same targets. As a result, most have not achieved the scale expected by their backers at this stage.\n\nâMergers will give the PE houses the opportunity to exit their positions with more scale and see a new set of investors into the market.â\n\n'We will walk away from a deal': how consolidators have become 'picky'\n\nJeffreys believed there would be three key themes that would dominate the M&A landscape in 2025, with the first being the number of firms coming to market.\n\nâThe buyer market is extensive â it is broad and deep and made up of a mix of firms seeking different outcomes from acquisitive growth.\n\nâThe market can absolutely support an uptick in firms for sale. However, there will be increased competition over the highest quality, and the risk that other firms fail to attract significant interest.\n\nâFurthermore, there is a risk a bottle-neck could occur in the FCAâs change in the team approving company sales. During Covid, we saw significant delays to deals due to the CIC taking significantly longer than anticipated, and if this happens again it may mean sellers looking to beat tax hike deadlines will not succeed.\n\nâIt could also lead to poor behaviour reported pre-budget, where it was rumoured some sales were going through without the necessary regulatory approvals,â she explained.\n\nJeffreys also predicted buyers would be putting significant focus on the integration of the firms they buy.\n\nIf supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted. Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the âbuy & buildâ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\nâThe consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\nâMany of the âbuy & buildâ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\nâThat further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.â\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labourâs first Budget for 14 years has had a âhuge impactâ on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\nâBADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\nâIt could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\nâFurthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale â potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,â she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

In addition, for these future acquisitions, the consulting firm will allocate 40 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the company, led by AgustÃ­n Vivancos, has its own M&A department led by a creative person with a financial profile. This team analyzes a portfolio of almost 300 companies per year, of which they contact about 100 and end up negotiating with three dozen of them. Some of these acquired companies end up becoming spin-offs, as is the case of True, Meme or Libero Creative Club, specialized in soccer.\n\nSince 2022, the consulting firm has already added a dozen new acquisitions. With the constant growth in size, Jungle faces the challenge of acquiring larger and larger companies, which implies more significant investments.\n\nThe company expects to close 2024 with a turnover of $40 million To ensure the profitability of these operations, the firm uses a growth and integration methodology based on three fundamental pillars: 1,000-day strategic planning, weekly accountability and management focused on a maximum of three KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, Jungle recordedtotal revenues of â¬27.2 million, a 49% growth compared to the previous year. The consultancy projects to close 2024 with revenues of â¬40 million and an estimated EBITDA of â¬7 million.

According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The companyâs insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloydâs portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrainâs GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the companyâs profitability. The companyâs investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the companyâs control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the companyâs operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the companyâs operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the companyâs portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Companyâs 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: á´ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. á´ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. á´ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company â¢ While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor âGulf Tamin Ltdâ was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. â¢ The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. â¢ As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Companyâs Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. â¢ The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholdersâ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the companyâs paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the companyâs shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIGâS REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIGâS INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, companyâs funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Directors further extend their thanks to our business partners, clients, staff and shareholders for their support and cooperation throughout the year.\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\n2 Shenton Way\n\n#13-02, SGX Centre 1\n\nSingapore City\n\nSGP\n\n65 65366618\n\n65 65366619\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nBrighton Place\n\nGround Floor, Shoplot No. U0215\n\nJalan Bahasa\n\nLabuan\n\nLabuan (Federal Territory of)\n\nMYS\n\n60 87 442899\n\n60 87 451899\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nUnit 12C, 12th Floor Raffles Tower\n\n19 Cybercity\n\nEbene\n\nMUS\n\n230 466 0112\n\n230 466 0114\n\nArig Capital Limited\n\n4th Floor\n\nMitre House\n\n12 14 Mitre Street\n\nGBR\n\n44 20 3207 0081\n\nGulf Warranties W.L.L\n\nPO Box 5209\n\nDubai\n\nBHR\n\n973 4 3355347\n\n973 4 3355679\n\nwww.gulfwarranties.com\n\nTakaful Re Limited\n\nDIFC, Dubai International Financial Centre\n\nThe gate district, Precinct building 3, level 4, Tenancy 3\n\nP.O.

         "* Barnes & Noble was acquired by Elliott Investment Management for $683 million in 2019.\n\nJames Daunt, the CEO of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, said he would open about 60 new stores in the US.\n\nThe British bookseller boss told the Financial Times that he is considering a future initial public offering in London or New York as well as the expansion.\n\nThroughout 2024, 57 Barnes & Noble locations were opened across the US, which currently has approximately 600 stores. In the UK, 12 new stores were added. Speaking about additions in the new year, Daunt said to the FT that he plans to \"do that or more in 2025.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest book chain in America. After he quit his investment banking job, Daunt launched Daunt Books in London in 1990 â where there are now about 10 stores. In 2011, he was appointed managing director of British bookseller Waterstones to help the struggling business, which faced growing competition from Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Waterstones was sold to Elliott Investment Management by Russian billionaire and publisher Alexander Mamut. Barnes & Noble was acquired by the same New York-headquartered hedge fund the following year for $683 million.\n\nDaunt was named CEO of both book retailers. He also continues to run his independent book chain in London.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble and Waterstones boss told the FT it would be \"logical\" to contemplate an IPO but that any plan would be based on Elliott's strategy for the future. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the FT reported there are no current plans to list the chains. However, it could be a possibility at a later stage.\n\nAt present, Daunt hopes to combine the IT and finance platforms at Barnes & Noble and Waterstones into one system.\n\nHe noted that it was a \"solid Christmas\" because as the holiday fell on a Wednesday, last-minute shoppers had the weekend before to purchase gifts.\n\n\"The last weekend and [December] 23-24 were exceptional on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he told the FT. \"It has been a good post-Christmas as well.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. Youâre ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.âbut canât quite find the time because thereâs already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And thenâwar breaks out in your country.\n\nThatâs what happened to my company. I work in the field of language servicesâtranslations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldnât be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work. Peopleâs immediate concerns were fuel (to flee), food, and medicine.\n\nThe strategy of âclaiming more local market shareâ seemed irrelevantâI thought there would be no market left to claim. Thankfully, I was wrong, and we continue to work actively in Ukraine. I was in despair for the first two days of the war but then decided that despair is not productive, so I put all my energy into work.\n\nThus, in early 2022, we made a 180-degree shift. We chose Poland as our new home market. It was the only growing economy in Europe, close to Ukraine, and provided an inroad to the European market. From there, we could both help our fellow Ukrainian businesspeople and expand internationally. Poland would become our launchpad for selling services worldwide.\n\nWe needed to âlocalizeâ ourselves in Europe. Ukraine is its own world, and Europeâthe EU in particularâis another, with its own rules we had yet to learn. Our goal was to âbecome part ofâ Europe.\n\nThe fastest, most logical solution was to acquire a company. We explored potential targets in Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didnât have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, âIt doesnât matter when the client buysânow or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,â it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a companyâs sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, âIt seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I donât really track that.â The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performedâall data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the companyâs direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, itâs critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didnât have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Ownerâs resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasnât appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we havenât lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europeâyet.\n\nClick to view image.",

         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processing,\" Blandinieres said.\n\nThat includes Soufflet Malt, one of the world's biggest producers of the barley-based beer and whisky ingredient.\n\nThe unit on Friday announced a 100 million euro investment to build a malt factory in South Africa with Heineken.\n\n($1 = 0.9161 euros) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Sybille de La Hamaide) ",

UK nationals who have already retired and living in Spain will also want to know whether this tax could be levied retrospectively.\"\n\nShe added: \"It should be noted that some consider the Spanish prime minister is politically vulnerable and this may simply be a pre-election soundbite to boost his popularity. Even if adopted, the legislative process in Spain is tortiously slow and it is perhaps a little early for UK nationals to worry about this proposal.\n\n\"If adopted, there are many other jurisdictions looking to attract wealthy retirees and investors. For example, Dubai has been called the âNew Marbella'.\"\n\nSpain has already set a date to close its so-called \"golden\" investor visa set up from 3 April this year. The visa previously gave foreign investors fast-tracked residency but will now be scrapped.\n\nFragomen is an immigration specialist law firm. Director Isobel Neilson said closing of the investor visa will be a \"huge blow for retirees from the UK looking to move to Spain\".\n\n\"They will now have to look to other passive routes to obtain residency such as the non-lucrative visa â this is unfortunately less flexible, does not allow the applicant to work (even remotely) in Spain and requires full-time residency (six months a year) to maintain the status.\n\n\"One of the requirements of this visa is that the applicant needs to evidence accommodation in Spain. This can either be through a lease or showing title deeds to a property in Spain.\n\n\"If the proposed 100% tax on homeownership for non-EU nationals were to be introduced our clients would most likely look to rent instead of buying or alternatively explore other more favourable EU jurisdictions offering similar status such as the D7 visa in Portugal or the elective residency permit in Italy.\"\n\nRead more: Retiring abroad: Helping clients get their place in the sun\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "In connection with the placement of EUR400 million cash-settled synthetic convertible bonds with a maturity of 5 years due 18 February 2030 (the \"Bonds\"), VINCI hereby notifies the holders of the Bonds of the following determinations and calculations: \n\n\n   -- The share reference price of VINCI's share is EUR108.4401; \n \n   -- The resulting initial conversion price (representing a premium of 20% \n      over the share reference price of VINCI's share) is EUR130.1281; and \n \n   -- The initial conversion ratio is 768.4735 VINCI shares per Bond of \n      EUR100,000 in principal amount. \n\nThe settlement and delivery of the Bonds took place today.\n\nAbout VINCI\n\nVINCI is a global player in concessions, energy and construction businesses, employing 285,000 people in more than 120 countries.

Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Bonds (a \"distributor\") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Bonds (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.\n\nFrance\n\nThe Bonds have not been and will not be offered or sold or cause to be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France other than to qualified investors.

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",

         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Gold currently trades 1.8% lower at $2,604.50 a troy ounce, with investors now waiting for U.S. PCE inflation data due on Friday. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n\n1104 ET - Brazilian assets are undervalued, \"but it will be challenging to reverse this negative trend,\" Santader economists write. The country faces a worsening fiscal situation, rising inflation and steep borrowing costs. The currency has lost 27% of its dollar value this year and the Ibovespa stock index is down nearly 10%. \"Local institutional clients are preparing for potential outflows by building up cash reserves, and foreign investors are also hesitant,\" Santander says. The economists expect persistently elevated risk premiums in the country. They say, however, that Brazil has a variety of competitive companies \"that are benefiting from secular trends.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1046 ET - The more cautious approach to interest-rate cuts signaled by the Bank of England feels risky, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

         "Constantinsborg A/S (Offeror) has decided to make an all-cash voluntary public tender offer all shares in FirstFarms A/S (FirstFarms) (other than own shares held by FirstFarms and shares already held by the Offeror) (the Offer) for a cash price of DKK 84 per share of nominally DKK 10 (the Offer Price). The Offeror is indirectly owned and controlled by Heartland A/S (Heartland) The Offeror will offer DKK 84 for each share of nominally DKK 10, subject to adjustment for any dividends or other distributions declared or paid to the shareholders of FirstFarms prior to completion of the Offer. The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025. The Offer values FirstFarms' entire share capital at approx. DKK 936 million. Further, the Offer Price corresponds at least to the price at which the Offeror is entitled to convert its existing convertible loan and which was determined and negotiated between the Offeror and FirstFarms in connection with the issuance of the loan on 29 February 2024. Completion of the Offer will be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, but completion will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarmsâ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained.

         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

         "Thomas Cook collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal, but now operates in the UK as an online-only travel agent.\n\nThe fine was originally Â£6.5million, but was discounted by 25 per cent 'for admissions and early disposal.' EY paid also paid the costs for the investigation.\n\nEY audit engagement partner Richard Wilson was fined Â£140,000, discounted to Â£105,000 for the same reason.\n\nThe FRC imposed sanctions on EY and Wilson over audits for the airline for the financial years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog said the airlineâs goodwill balance was significant, comprising Â£2.6billion across the whole group, roughly 40 per cent of total assets.\n\nThe breaches related to assessing Thomas Cook's goodwill impairment level and going concern status, as well as adequately considering the risk to EY's independence during the 2018 audit, the FRC said.\n\nFollowing an investigation, it was found that for both audit years, EY and Wilson failed to 'approach this audit area with sufficient professional scepticism to properly corroborate managementâs assumptions and estimates supporting the goodwill impairment model'.\n\nThe FRC said 'the failings' for this 'were particularly serious' for 2018 'given Thomas Cookâs deteriorating trading performance, which heightened the risk that the goodwill balance could be impaired.'\n\nClaudia Mortimore, FRC deputy executive counsel, said: 'EY and Mr Wilsonâs failure to challenge robustly and to apply sufficient professional scepticism in these crucial areas led to significant breaches of auditing standards in both audit years.\n\n'The failings in 2018 are particularly serious given Thomas Cookâs financial position and the heightened risks surrounding the audit work.\n\n'EYâs remedial measures together with the programme of non-financial sanctions are designed to prevent such failures being repeated.'\n\nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed in 2019 after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding more than 100,000 passengers overseas and leaving many without jobs.\n\nChinese company Fosun later acquired the company's brand, before selling it to Polish travel platform eSky Group last year.",

         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "The Toffees boss insists any sales this month will be only if theyâre bringing in a better player. The club was finally taken over by the Friedkin Group last month when the American firm got Premier League approval.\n\nIt follows years of penny pinching when Farhad Moshiriâs wild spending dried up and left the Toffees stuck with financial problems which led to points deductions last season.\n\nThe club has sold star assets like Anthony Gordon, Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana since Dyche arrived two years ago. But now, ahead of todayâs clash at Bournemouth, he insists the only sales happening will be if it is to make room for better players as the new owners bring stability.\n\nâApart from the PSR thing, the stability is there so that has changed,â said Dyche. âThereâs not that need but you still have to work the right market. These guys [TFG] are certainly not wanting to weaken us. Itâs the rules, not the intent.\n\nâWhat youâre saying is kind of right but it [sales] has to make us stronger. We are not under any pressure to get weaker by selling players but what can you do to make us stronger\n\nâThat is the good side of having the stability the owners talked about. We donât need to do anything, that has changed. It is about decision-making. Within the guidelines of the PSR. If we can sell one and bring someone in, that is something we would have to look at.â\n\nRelegation battling Everton, who go to Bournemouth looking for their first win at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League, have yet to have any interest in their current squad this month.\n\nMisfiring forward Beto is one player who may be on the way out if the right offer comes along though as he has struggled to deliver while on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja is now fit to compete with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nâLetâs see what the market offers,â said Dyche. âWe have had no phone-calls, we are making lots of them to see what we can do, see what is around and what can open.\n\nâAt the end of the day, our situation here is that we certainly will not be letting anyone go unless we are needed to. Unless of course we can swap and change. We want to keep the squad, we have had injuries and been very stretched. We are certainly not looking to have players going out.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community \n\nand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The club are not putting a figure on the takeover and say all the clubâs various debts have been converted to long-term debts.\n\nAmerican billionaire Dan Friedkin, who also owns Roma, will stick by Dyche as he battles to keep Everton in the top flight ahead of their move to their new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock.\n\nFriedkin will also stick with director of football Kevin Thelwell, who has significantly reduced the clubâs transfer spending and wage bill with Dyche.\n\nThe focus will be on maintaining the clubâs position in the Premier League and the Blues are 16th, three points above the relegation zone.\n\nDan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of TFG is proposed to be Chairman of the Board. He has appointed Marc Watts to serve as Executive Chairman, who will be responsible in this role for the management of the club. Ana Dunkel, TFGâs Chief Financial Officer and Colin Chong, the Clubâs interim CEO will also serve on the Board. Additional appointments will be made in the coming weeks.\n\nRepresentatives from TFG will be present at Goodison Park for Evertonâs next game against Chelsea on Sunday and the club hope to confirm who in the coming days.\n\nWatts says TFG want to bring some much-needed stability to the club after last seasonâs points deductions for failing PSR regulations. âToday marks a momentous and proud occasion for The Friedkin Group as we become custodians of this iconic football club,â he said.\n\nâWe are committed to leading Everton into an exciting new era both on and off the pitch. Providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority, and we are delighted to have achieved this.\n\nâWhile restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey.â\n\nMoshiri could not deliver success despite spending big and has been looking to sell his shares for some time. He said: âI truly believe that the transaction with The Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success.\n\nâThere has been a huge team effort in getting to this stage and I would like to personally thank my board colleagues John Spellman and Colin Chong and all the senior management team including Katie, James, Richard and of course Kevin and Sean for their huge commitment to the club.\n\nâDespite a challenging geopolitical backdrop, a significant amount has been achieved over the last couple of years including the delivery of a new sporting department, the stabilisation of our finances and the delivery of our iconic new stadium.\n\nâI now hand over to new owners confident in the outlook for the club and that our incredible fans will see the success on the pitch that they so thoroughly deserve.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "Roundhouse Capital Holdings Limited Roundhouse, which is an entity within The Friedkin Group, have bought Farhad Moshiriâs 94.1 per cent stake in the club. The club are not putting a figure on the takeover and say all the clubâs various debts have been converted to long-term debts.\n\nAmerican billionaire Dan Friedkin, who also owns Roma, will stick by Dyche as he battles to keep Everton in the top flight ahead of their move to their new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock.\n\nFriedkin will also stick with director of football Kevin Thelwell, who has significantly reduced the clubâs transfer spending and wage bill with Dyche.\n\nThe focus will be on maintaining the clubâs position in the Premier League and the Blues are 16th, three points above the relegation zone.\n\nDan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of TFG is proposed to be Chairman of the Board. He has appointed Marc Watts to serve as Executive Chairman, who will be responsible in this role for the management of the club. Ana Dunkel, TFGâs Chief Financial Officer and Colin Chong, the Clubâs interim CEO will also serve on the Board. Additional appointments will be made in the coming weeks.\n\nRepresentatives from TFG will be present at Goodison Park for Evertonâs next game against Chelsea on Sunday and the club hope to confirm who in the coming days.\n\nWatts says TFG want to bring some much-needed stability to the club after last seasonâs points deductions for failing PSR regulations. âToday marks a momentous and proud occasion for The Friedkin Group as we become custodians of this iconic football club,â he said.\n\nâWe are committed to leading Everton into an exciting new era both on and off the pitch. Providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority, and we are delighted to have achieved this.\n\nâWhile restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey.â\n\nMoshiri could not deliver success despite spending big and has been looking to sell his shares for some time. He said: âI truly believe that the transaction with The Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success.\n\nâThere has been a huge team effort in getting to this stage and I would like to personally thank my board colleagues John Spellman and Colin Chong and all the senior management team including Katie, James, Richard and of course Kevin and Sean for their huge commitment to the club.\n\nâDespite a challenging geopolitical backdrop, a significant amount has been achieved over the last couple of years including the delivery of a new sporting department, the stabilisation of our finances and the delivery of our iconic new stadium.\n\nâI now hand over to new owners confident in the outlook for the club and that our incredible fans will see the success on the pitch that they so thoroughly deserve.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "The investment platforms operator reported a 29 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record Â£113.3 million and set out plans for a Â£30 million share buyback.\n\nRevenues grew by 23 per cent to Â£269.4 million on the back of winning a net 66,000 new customers, taking its customer base to 557,000.\n\nThe company said that the net interest it earned from customer balances increased in the year to September, but declined to quantify it, saying that the run rate peaked in March.\n\nMichael Summersgill, chief executive, said the firm was highly competitive looking at âpricing in the roundâ. Interest it pays to customers on their balances ranges from 1.8 per cent for cash in a dealing account up to as much as 4.27 per cent for cash held in some pension accounts.\n\nâWeâre an investment platform. People donât come to us to hold cash,â he said. âWe give great value to our customers.â\n\nInvestment platforms have come under pressure to improve their pricing with the Financial Conduct Authority writing to all of them reminding them of their responsibilities under\n\nthe new consumer duty \n\n.\n\nFor years, platforms made no money on customer balances, with base rate close to zero. But rises in base rate to a high of 5.25 per cent throughout the year to July has delivered them lucrative windfalls. Base rate has since come down to 4.75 per cent.\n\nFavourable market movements during the year added Â£9.5 billion to total assets under management, while net customer inflows of Â£6.1 billion, a rise from Â£4.2 billion last time, pushed the total figure to Â£86.5 million.\n\nSummersgill said successful advertising had helped the group, pushing spontaneous awareness of the brand above 50 per cent from 30 per cent two years ago.\n\nAJ Bell is a Top 3 investment platform business, serving DIY investors directly through its direct-to-customer unit and serving another tranche indirectly through a platform for financial advisers. It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14Â½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. âOver the long term I wouldnât say weâll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.â\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than Â£800,000 a year ago to Â£6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: âThe long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.â\n\nPensions tax âis unworkableâ\n\nThe governmentâs plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bellâs chief executive has said.\n\nâIt is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,â Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: âIf the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,â he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased personâs estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise Â£640 million in 2027-28, Â£1.34 billion in 2028-29 and Â£1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: âMost estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first Â£325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to Â£500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and Â£1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\nâWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.â",

         "As announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. Additionally, the Company has undertaken not to carry out or propose any additional issuances of shares or other securities in the Company, without the consent of Carnegie, for a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. The Company's lock-up undertaking includes an exemption for any consideration shares to be issued in connection with the potential acquisition of Dignitana.\n\nAdvisers\n\nCarnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner in connection with the Share Issue. Advokatfirman Delphi acted as legal adviser to the Company in connection with the Share Issue.",

         "Impending fintech consolidation could yield unprecedented exit values, says Artis Partners; Acquisitions have already become the norm in the payments space, with the wider sector now set to follow suit",
         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 â an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Eliteâs acquisition of Tranch and Neonomicsâ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",
         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: âAn M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. Weâre already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\nâThe key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers â sometimes direct rivals â in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\nâMany of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\nâAs a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months. If founders arenât considering a strategic exit, they could miss out on a prime opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market, and risk losing ground to rivals who stand to benefit from a larger pool of resources through acquisition.â\n\nBasta concluded: âPursuing the funding route will only dilute ownership stakes and reduce overall profitability when the time eventually comes to sell; even more so today since the fundraising market has not come back nearly as strongly as M&A. Itâs time for fintechs to begin the exit planning phase to ensure they remain competitive and take advantage of the industryâs significant momentum.â\n\n-ENDS-\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout Artis Partners\n\nArtis Partners is a boutique investment bank specialising in strategic M&A and fundraising, delivering high exit values for growth stage European and US technology companies.

         "UK's private share trading plan will be a flop, says buyout veteran Jon Moulton; Pisces has come under criticism in recent weeks",
         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "Nearly two years after the outbreak of the so-called Factop case, the brothers Ariel and Daniel Sauer continue to be the focus of new legal actions by those who claim to be victims of the scheme of false invoices and irregular financing unleashed within the factoring company.\n\nThis Monday, the foreign investment fund \"EMF Microfinance Fund AGmvK\" of the Swiss fund manager Enabling Qapital filed a lawsuit against the brothers and main shareholders of Factop, for the crimes of fraud and forgery, as well as malicious use of a private commercial instrument.",
         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million. To which are added what would have been accrued for the interest rate of 15.6% of the capital owed, \"payable in six installments, of which only one was paid\".",

         "National financial planner The Finli Group has completed its acquisition of Schaefer Financial Management.\n\nIn February this year, Finli - formerly Solomon Capital Holdings - agreed a deal to acquire Schaefer Financial Management in Somerset. The acquisition of MMR Financial Planning which took place in March in Birmingham brings the firm's total acquisitions to 41.",
         "This is its second completed acquisition in two months. Finli said it is on target to complete further deals this month across Kent, Cardiff, Merseyside and Somerset, feeding directly into three of its core regions.\n\nThe firm, which has four regions in total and offices across England, Scotland and Wales, is looking to grow its local presence in Scotland, the north of England, central England and southern regions.\n\nIn January last year, Finli snapped up Scottish IFA Clark Gillone following its previous purchases of Beaufort Group and Gale and Phillipson.\n\nIt aims to add Â£1bn in assets annually and said it is open to speaking to adviser firms of all sizes from Â£25m under advice.\n\nFinli acquisitions director Jon Barham said: \"Acquiring firms often talk about the ideal size of a firm looking to sell.\n\n\"For us, it's about the ideal attitude. If you want to do right by your clients, then we want to talk to you!\"\n\nFinancial planners rank the reputation of acquiring firm above what they'll pay\n\nA recent poll conducted by Finli showed financial planners give greater consideration to the reputation of potential acquirers than they do the sum they are prepared to pay for their business - with 93% strongly agreeing with the statement \"it is paramount that the firm I sell to has a good reputation compared to just 47 per cent who strongly agree with the statement that it is paramount that I am paid a good price\".\n\nFinli said that it is \"never just about the money\" and that there are emotional considerations that need to be given due thought when taking on another financial planner's clients.\n\nThe recently rebranded national said that the narrative around acquiring books of business is \"all too often exclusively focused on the onboarding mechanics and the numbers â the size of each tranche that is to be seeded across each month\".\n\nThe firm asked financial planners what their aspirations were for themselves and their clients when they come to retire.\n\nSome 78% strongly agreed that it is paramount to know that they made a difference in their clients' lives,15% strongly agreed that it is paramount that they can retain a non-advisory relationship with their clients (with a further 32% somewhat agreeing), 95% strongly agree that they want their clients to know the firm they've chosen to take over from them is their parting good 'advice', and 100% strongly agree that they want their clients to feel listened to, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, 80% strongly agree (and 18% somewhat agree) that it is important that the firm that takes over is culturally aligned with their values and those of their clients.\n\n\"Of course, financial planners want to get a good price for their business. And so they should. However, these are businesses that have been built on nurturing relationships, some spanning several decades. So, it should come as no surprise that financial planners place so much importance on the acquiring firm having a good reputation for looking after clients â even that it Top Trumps the sale price,\" said Finli group chief distribution officer Simon Goldthorpe.\n\nGoldthorpe added: \"Of course, they can have both when it's the right fit! However, understanding and, importantly, appreciating that any deal is as much about emotions as it is about the headline figure and the mechanics of the sale is in everyone's best interests. These findings act as a timely reminder of the need to place equal weighting on both.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "The impact of employer NICs hike on M&A valuations",
         "The adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.\n\nThe adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.",
         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: âThe increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

         "M&A process a 'disturbing event' for IFAs",
         "The acquisition process can prove a troubling event for staff and owners, experts told PA, but there are ways that buyers and sellers can best manage this.\n\nSpeaking to Professional Adviser, The Flower Group founder Gordon Flower labelled deals \"a disturbing event for IFA owners and the people involved\". Flower added that the acquisition process has \"an emotional toll on everyone involved, particularly those who are being acquired\".",
         "\"People are scared of losing their jobs,\" Flower explained.\n\nThe Flower Group was launched in July 2023 to support the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process for the wealth management sector. Last month (24 January), it unveiled its M&A support service for the wealth management sector, said to \"reduce transaction timelines by an average of six weeks\".\n\nFor those looking to acquire businesses, Flower suggested considering \"good client data\". \"Acquirers like to hear that a business cares about its clients, such as when someone remembers the small things about their clients, rather than viewing their clients as numbers,\" he noted. \"Listening skills are very important in this space.\"\n\nHe added: \"When you're looking to acquire a business, you need to think to yourself, âCan I see this business fit in with us?'\"\n\nFlower noted that many business owners fear losing value during acquisitions. \"They ask themselves, âIs this going to reduce my value?'\" he said.\n\nTo alleviate such concerns, The Flower Group helps prepare sellers for the demands of due diligence and supports acquirers with key insights into the cultural and operational dynamics of their targets.\n\nEnsuring cultural fit and human capital stability\n\nHoxton Wealth founder and CEO Chris Ball highlighted the importance of understanding whether the human capital within the business will remain post-acquisition.\n\n\"Are you buying someone's book that's retiring? If so, then it's important that if they're saying they're retiring, they actually retire,\" Ball explained. \"If they don't have a real reason for retiring, they may find it too difficult and emotional to leave and could return, which creates challenges.\"\n\nHe also stressed the importance of evaluating existing employees before completing the acquisition.\n\n\"If you're keeping the human capital, it's important to meet those people before you buy the business. You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their âbaby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this â often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to Â£3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locationsâsuch as whether employees will work remotely or in an officeâneed to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open â being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation â leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach â communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration â it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being âdone to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer â ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "I received the proceeds of 13 AIB shares, having opted to sell these under the scheme announced by the bank for small shareholders some time back. The shares represent a huge dilution of the original shares which were acquired over many years between the early 1990s and roughly 2007.\n\nWould you know how I would go about calculating the capital loss on these shares in case I need to offset gains somewhere else? Some of the shares may have been acquired by way of scrip dividends, which adds to the complexity.",
         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those â¬13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of â¬73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank. The â¬5.65 a share offer â a 5 per cent premium to the market price â was simply the final insult in an investment that has proven catastrophic over the past 14 years.\n\nThose 250 shares that would have been worth â¬17.50 just before the consolidation announcement, and â¬8.75 on the last day the old shares traded on December 18th, became a single share which was worth â¬8.50 at the close of trading on December 21st. However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of â¬6,000 â â¬5,987.50 to be precise â at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way. At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of â¬78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares â shares given in lieu of cash dividends â the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the â¬18.98 a share the bankâs stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the â¬5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. Thatâs 2.26 cent. So your loss on that dayâs trade is almost â¬18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records â or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares â for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, youâll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYouâre talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain â because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price â for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

         "UPDATE 1-Azimut targets March sale of 80% stake in fintech bank to FSI",
         "*\n\nAzimut plans to sell 80% of fintech bank to FSI by March",
         "*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms.

BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business.

         "The National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) has accepted one of Banc Sabadell's demands and will open the market test it is finalizing regarding BBVA's takeover bid for the Catalan bank to both business associations and trade unions, according to industry sources.\n\nThis was one of the requests of Sabadell's chairman, Josep Oliu, who has even compared the lack of participation of these agents in the market test to \"asking the fox if he wants the hens to run free\".",
         "During the in-depth analysis of the operation, known as phase two, the CNMC rejected the allegations of 79 associations and only accepted that of Sabadell, considering that it is the only one with a legitimate interest. Two of the organizations that submitted allegations, Foment del Treball and UGT, have filed appeals before the National Court, both of which have been admitted for processing.\n\nThe market test has not yet been launched, but some associations have already been informed that they will be taken into account. By opening the procedure, they will at least have the opportunity to express their opinion during this process on an operation which, they say, limits competition, especially in the SME business, and puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStructural conditions of conductThe market test is being launched after the agreement of commitments between BBVA and the CNMC, in which the behavioral guidelines set out by the opting bank are maintained, mainly related to measures such as maintaining branches except those that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters and commercial conditions for customers for a certain period.\n\nThe CNMC accepts BBVA's approach, although tightening the time commitments, which in some aspects go up to three years. This is a different approach to that advocated by Sabadell, which calls for structural measures and asks that the market test itself should ask the sector whether BBVA should sell assets in order to maintain competition.\n\nOnce the test has been launched, the sector's agents will have ten working days to reply, after which the CNMC's Competition Directorate will submit the final report to the plenary for approval of the opinion.\n\nIt is at that moment when the Ministry of Economy will have 15 days to decide whether to analyze the file and, within 30 additional days, submit it to the Council of Ministers, which may establish additional conditions to BBVA.\n\nBBVA is confident that it will be able to launch the takeover bid in June, although the next few days will be key to determine the speed of the process and whether, given the holiday break, the operation will be postponed until after August.",

         "ING's role (past, present and future) in BBVA's takeover bid for Sabadell",
         "ING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.\n\nThe entity has been very explicit in recognizing that it wants to grow in markets such as Spain, much more than what banks usually do before carrying out relevant operations. \"We want to grow in larger markets, such as Italy, Spain and Germany,\" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in early February. \"M&A is an option everywhere, if it fits our criteria,\" he added.",
         "Spain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio JuliÃ¡, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena RomÃ¡n as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena RomÃ¡n returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put RomÃ¡n in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique PiÃ±el as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

         "For family offices, high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) considering the purchase of luxury assets (in particular yachts, artworks and aircraft) there are multiple factors to consider, not least deciding on the optimum structure to purchase and hold such luxury assets.\n\nWhen purchasing a luxury asset, one of the first considerations should be the structure through which such luxury asset will be purchased and subsequently held. One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",
         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured âoff balance sheetâ and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from âlimited liability recourseâ meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise, currently not available to the general public.\n\nTax Neutrality: The BVI is tax neutral meaning that there is no income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax levied in the BVI. In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "Torres (BBVA) expects the CNMC to authorize the takeover bid for Sabadell in the \"coming weeks\" and conclude before the summer.",
         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper InformaciÃ³n in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",
         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide. The shareholder is king, just as everyone is king with their own property. When you want to sell your house, it is up to you to decide whether to sell it or not. Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del MediterrÃ¡neo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "BBVA defends the takeover bid for Sabadell: \"We do not expect the Government to impose a veto on the operation\".",
         "The Chairman and CEO of BBVA, Carlos Torres, expressed his satisfaction with BBVA's record annual profits, above 10,000 million euros, thanks to the improvement in all markets and business areas. This was another reason for him to defend the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, about which he commented that \"Europe needs larger banks to be able to make the necessary investments to maintain a sustainable position for the future. This operation gives us the opportunity to have more than 5,000 million in financing, which means paying more taxes, a greater global reach based on meritocracy and the creation of value for shareholders that the operation entails. Together we can achieve greater goals that would be impossible to achieve separately.",
         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at TelefÃ³nica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Ãlvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in TelefÃ³nica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the â¬0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of â¬0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate â¬5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents â¬0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa GÃ³mez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, GÃ³mez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

         "Smaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.\n\nSmaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.",
         "Jeffreys told FT Adviser she expected more changes to happen within the M&A market in the coming 12 months - and it would be the acquirers and consolidators themselves who might consolidate.\n\nShe said: âMany PE-backed acquirers took investment in 2019, so the PE houses will be on a countdown to exit their positions, and a wave of transactions is likely.\n\nâThe number of new entrant buyers at that point in time (approximately 15 firms) left many buyers competing over the same targets. As a result, most have not achieved the scale expected by their backers at this stage.\n\nâMergers will give the PE houses the opportunity to exit their positions with more scale and see a new set of investors into the market.â\n\n'We will walk away from a deal': how consolidators have become 'picky'\n\nJeffreys believed there would be three key themes that would dominate the M&A landscape in 2025, with the first being the number of firms coming to market.\n\nâThe buyer market is extensive â it is broad and deep and made up of a mix of firms seeking different outcomes from acquisitive growth.\n\nâThe market can absolutely support an uptick in firms for sale. However, there will be increased competition over the highest quality, and the risk that other firms fail to attract significant interest.\n\nâFurthermore, there is a risk a bottle-neck could occur in the FCAâs change in the team approving company sales. During Covid, we saw significant delays to deals due to the CIC taking significantly longer than anticipated, and if this happens again it may mean sellers looking to beat tax hike deadlines will not succeed.\n\nâIt could also lead to poor behaviour reported pre-budget, where it was rumoured some sales were going through without the necessary regulatory approvals,â she explained.\n\nJeffreys also predicted buyers would be putting significant focus on the integration of the firms they buy.\n\nIf supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted. Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the âbuy & buildâ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\nâThe consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\nâMany of the âbuy & buildâ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\nâThat further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.â\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labourâs first Budget for 14 years has had a âhuge impactâ on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\nâBADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\nâIt could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\nâFurthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale â potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,â she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

         "The acquisition of firms is a common practice in the consulting sector, with recent examples among the Big Four and large technology companies, such as EY with the purchase of Attalea Partners, Deloitte acquiring Keytree or Accenture integrating Axis Corporate. Although this approach is not usually the main driver of growth for these companies, there are already international firms such as McKinsey that are showing more and more interest in this type of strategy. In this scenario, Jungle, despite being significantly smaller than these large consulting firms, is positioned as one of the few firms that bases its growth strategy on a programmatic M&A, with the goal of acquiring up to four firms a year.",
         "This Spanish company, which is listed on the French market, but is considering listing in Spain next year, recently closed its fourth annual purchase, with the acquisition of Move Branding, which joins the other three consulting firms acquired this year: the technology firm MilÃº, the creative agency BUM and Liquid Lab, a technology consulting firm owned by the former CEO of Mobile World Capital Barcelona.\n\nBoth in this last acquisition and in the other 10 that Jungle intends to make from 2025 onwards, it is relying on the advice of Grant Thornton and the GÃ³mez Acebo law firm. In addition, for these future acquisitions, the consulting firm will allocate 40 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the company, led by AgustÃ­n Vivancos, has its own M&A department led by a creative person with a financial profile. This team analyzes a portfolio of almost 300 companies per year, of which they contact about 100 and end up negotiating with three dozen of them. Some of these acquired companies end up becoming spin-offs, as is the case of True, Meme or Libero Creative Club, specialized in soccer.\n\nSince 2022, the consulting firm has already added a dozen new acquisitions. With the constant growth in size, Jungle faces the challenge of acquiring larger and larger companies, which implies more significant investments.\n\nThe company expects to close 2024 with a turnover of $40 million To ensure the profitability of these operations, the firm uses a growth and integration methodology based on three fundamental pillars: 1,000-day strategic planning, weekly accountability and management focused on a maximum of three KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, Jungle recordedtotal revenues of â¬27.2 million, a 49% growth compared to the previous year. The consultancy projects to close 2024 with revenues of â¬40 million and an estimated EBITDA of â¬7 million. Among its main clients are large listed companies such as Inditex, BBVA and LÃ­nea Directa.\n\nThe acquisition of firms is a common practice in the consulting sector, with recent examples among the Big Four and large technology companies, such as EY with the purchase of Attalea Partners, Deloitte acquiring Keytree or Accenture integrating Axis Corporate. Although this approach is not usually the main driver of growth for these companies, there are already international firms such as McKinsey that are showing more and more interest in this type of strategy. In this scenario, Jungle, despite being significantly smaller than these large consulting firms, is positioned as one of the few firms that bases its growth strategy on a programmatic M&A, with the goal of acquiring up to four firms per year.",

Solvency position, broad product portfolio and investment income status are the key strengths of the company, even as its premium earnings remain causes for concern. A short-term economic outlook of Bahrain, a positive outlook for the non-life insurance segment in Bahrain and UAE, could provide ample growth opportunities for the company. However, risks related to online identity theft and hacking, fluctuations in interest rates, and intense competition could affect the companyâs business performance.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nSolvency\n\nInvestment Income\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nARIGâs broad product portfolio enables it to enhance its scalability to cater to the distinctive requirements of its clientele. The company offers a range of non-life and life reinsurance products and services across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Its portfolio of reinsurance products includes treaty reinsurance, life reinsurance, medical reinsurance, and property reinsurance. It also offers facultative reinsurance for specialty lines, such as casualty, engineering, marine hull, cargo, marine liabilities, and motor extended warranty. ARIGâs services include risk management, account handling, and claims payment services.\n\nSolvency\n\nSound solvency of the company strengthens its ability to borrow and repay the money, which in turn enhances its business operations. According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The companyâs insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloydâs portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrainâs GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the companyâs profitability. The companyâs investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the companyâs control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the companyâs operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the companyâs operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the companyâs portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Companyâs 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: á´ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. á´ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. á´ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company â¢ While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor âGulf Tamin Ltdâ was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. â¢ The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. â¢ As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Companyâs Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. â¢ The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholdersâ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the companyâs paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the companyâs shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIGâS REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIGâS INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, companyâs funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Directors further extend their thanks to our business partners, clients, staff and shareholders for their support and cooperation throughout the year.\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\n2 Shenton Way\n\n#13-02, SGX Centre 1\n\nSingapore City\n\nSGP\n\n65 65366618\n\n65 65366619\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nBrighton Place\n\nGround Floor, Shoplot No. U0215\n\nJalan Bahasa\n\nLabuan\n\nLabuan (Federal Territory of)\n\nMYS\n\n60 87 442899\n\n60 87 451899\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nUnit 12C, 12th Floor Raffles Tower\n\n19 Cybercity\n\nEbene\n\nMUS\n\n230 466 0112\n\n230 466 0114\n\nArig Capital Limited\n\n4th Floor\n\nMitre House\n\n12 14 Mitre Street\n\nGBR\n\n44 20 3207 0081\n\nGulf Warranties W.L.L\n\nPO Box 5209\n\nDubai\n\nBHR\n\n973 4 3355347\n\n973 4 3355679\n\nwww.gulfwarranties.com\n\nTakaful Re Limited\n\nDIFC, Dubai International Financial Centre\n\nThe gate district, Precinct building 3, level 4, Tenancy 3\n\nP.O.

         "* Barnes & Noble plans to open around 60 new stores in the US, says CEO James Daunt.\n\n* Daunt said it would be \"logical\" to consider a future initial public offering in London or New York.",
         "* Barnes & Noble was acquired by Elliott Investment Management for $683 million in 2019.\n\nJames Daunt, the CEO of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, said he would open about 60 new stores in the US.\n\nThe British bookseller boss told the Financial Times that he is considering a future initial public offering in London or New York as well as the expansion.\n\nThroughout 2024, 57 Barnes & Noble locations were opened across the US, which currently has approximately 600 stores. In the UK, 12 new stores were added. Speaking about additions in the new year, Daunt said to the FT that he plans to \"do that or more in 2025.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest book chain in America. After he quit his investment banking job, Daunt launched Daunt Books in London in 1990 â where there are now about 10 stores. In 2011, he was appointed managing director of British bookseller Waterstones to help the struggling business, which faced growing competition from Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Waterstones was sold to Elliott Investment Management by Russian billionaire and publisher Alexander Mamut. Barnes & Noble was acquired by the same New York-headquartered hedge fund the following year for $683 million.\n\nDaunt was named CEO of both book retailers. He also continues to run his independent book chain in London.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble and Waterstones boss told the FT it would be \"logical\" to contemplate an IPO but that any plan would be based on Elliott's strategy for the future. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the FT reported there are no current plans to list the chains. However, it could be a possibility at a later stage.\n\nAt present, Daunt hopes to combine the IT and finance platforms at Barnes & Noble and Waterstones into one system.\n\nHe noted that it was a \"solid Christmas\" because as the holiday fell on a Wednesday, last-minute shoppers had the weekend before to purchase gifts.\n\n\"The last weekend and [December] 23-24 were exceptional on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he told the FT. \"It has been a good post-Christmas as well.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

         "5 Red Flags to Watch Out for in Small Business Acquisitions",
         "Recognize the warning signs to help avoid costly mistakes in your next merger or acquisition.\n\nNatalia Tkachenko-Horbachevska, an Entrepreneursâ Organization (EO) member in Ukraine, is the founder and CEO of Task Force language services, which CSA Research 2024 ranked in the TOP 5 fastest-growing language services companies globally. From her offices in Poland and Ukraine, Tkachenko-Horbachevska shared her U.S. growth strategy journey, which includes a lesson on mergers and acquisitions.",
         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. Youâre ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.âbut canât quite find the time because thereâs already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And thenâwar breaks out in your country.\n\nThatâs what happened to my company. I work in the field of language servicesâtranslations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldnât be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work. Peopleâs immediate concerns were fuel (to flee), food, and medicine.\n\nThe strategy of âclaiming more local market shareâ seemed irrelevantâI thought there would be no market left to claim. Thankfully, I was wrong, and we continue to work actively in Ukraine. I was in despair for the first two days of the war but then decided that despair is not productive, so I put all my energy into work.\n\nThus, in early 2022, we made a 180-degree shift. We chose Poland as our new home market. It was the only growing economy in Europe, close to Ukraine, and provided an inroad to the European market. From there, we could both help our fellow Ukrainian businesspeople and expand internationally. Poland would become our launchpad for selling services worldwide.\n\nWe needed to âlocalizeâ ourselves in Europe. Ukraine is its own world, and Europeâthe EU in particularâis another, with its own rules we had yet to learn. Our goal was to âbecome part ofâ Europe.\n\nThe fastest, most logical solution was to acquire a company. We explored potential targets in Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didnât have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, âIt doesnât matter when the client buysânow or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,â it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a companyâs sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, âIt seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I donât really track that.â The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performedâall data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the companyâs direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, itâs critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didnât have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Ownerâs resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasnât appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we havenât lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europeâyet.\n\nClick to view image.",

         "Fibre operator Retelit, owned by Spanish infrastructure fund Asterion, has reached a preliminary deal to acquire BT's remaining operations in Italy, confirming earlier reports. In a short statement, Retelit said the assets included in the transaction generated revenues of around EUR 160 million in 2024, without disclosing the financial terms agreed upon.\n\nThe B2B specialist did specify that the acquisition would serve to enhance its proprietary fibre-optic network by an additional 11,500 km to over 47,000 km, while adding a further 10 MW of power capacity to its national data centre infrastructure. It would also boost its suite of ICT infrastructure and services to support the innovation and the digital transformation of Italian businesses.",
         "The deal, which is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, will also result in over 360 existing domestic business clients of BT in Italy transitioning to Retelit. In 2023, the company acquired regional fibre operator BT Enia from BT Italia to boost its fibre and data centre footprint in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nBT has been looking to withdraw from Italy since booking a GBP 530 million charge in 2017 following a false accounting scandal, subsequently selling two business units to TIM in 2021.",

         "France's InVivo seeks Ukraine silos for postwar grain trading push",
         "PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - French agriculture firm InVivo is looking to acquire silos at Ukraine's Odesa port to bolster its global trading business and refocus on its cereal activities, its chief executive told Reuters.\n\nDespite massive destruction since Russia's invasion, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest grain exporters via its Black Sea ports in the Odesa region.",
         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processing,\" Blandinieres said.\n\nThat includes Soufflet Malt, one of the world's biggest producers of the barley-based beer and whisky ingredient.\n\nThe unit on Friday announced a 100 million euro investment to build a malt factory in South Africa with Heineken.\n\n($1 = 0.9161 euros) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Sybille de La Hamaide) ",

         "He said non-EU residents bought 27,000 Spanish properties in 2023 with many destined for the rental market.\n\nPre-election soundbite?\n\nSeila Sanches Lucas is a UK and Spanish-qualified lawyer at the international law firm Broadfield who helps clients buy and sell property in Spain.\n\nShe said: \"The proposal by the Spanish prime minister will be concerning for those that have already chosen to retire in Spain and for those considering a retirement in the sun.\n\n\"It is just a proposal at this point in time and is not guaranteed to make it onto the Spanish statute books.\n\n\"It would be interesting to know whether this proposal would extend to the entire country or to particularly regions. UK nationals who have already retired and living in Spain will also want to know whether this tax could be levied retrospectively.\"\n\nShe added: \"It should be noted that some consider the Spanish prime minister is politically vulnerable and this may simply be a pre-election soundbite to boost his popularity. Even if adopted, the legislative process in Spain is tortiously slow and it is perhaps a little early for UK nationals to worry about this proposal.\n\n\"If adopted, there are many other jurisdictions looking to attract wealthy retirees and investors. For example, Dubai has been called the âNew Marbella'.\"\n\nSpain has already set a date to close its so-called \"golden\" investor visa set up from 3 April this year. The visa previously gave foreign investors fast-tracked residency but will now be scrapped.\n\nFragomen is an immigration specialist law firm. Director Isobel Neilson said closing of the investor visa will be a \"huge blow for retirees from the UK looking to move to Spain\".\n\n\"They will now have to look to other passive routes to obtain residency such as the non-lucrative visa â this is unfortunately less flexible, does not allow the applicant to work (even remotely) in Spain and requires full-time residency (six months a year) to maintain the status.\n\n\"One of the requirements of this visa is that the applicant needs to evidence accommodation in Spain. This can either be through a lease or showing title deeds to a property in Spain.\n\n\"If the proposed 100% tax on homeownership for non-EU nationals were to be introduced our clients would most likely look to rent instead of buying or alternatively explore other more favourable EU jurisdictions offering similar status such as the D7 visa in Portugal or the elective residency permit in Italy.\"\n\nRead more: Retiring abroad: Helping clients get their place in the sun\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",
         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Gold currently trades 1.8% lower at $2,604.50 a troy ounce, with investors now waiting for U.S. PCE inflation data due on Friday. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n\n1104 ET - Brazilian assets are undervalued, \"but it will be challenging to reverse this negative trend,\" Santader economists write. The country faces a worsening fiscal situation, rising inflation and steep borrowing costs. The currency has lost 27% of its dollar value this year and the Ibovespa stock index is down nearly 10%. \"Local institutional clients are preparing for potential outflows by building up cash reserves, and foreign investors are also hesitant,\" Santander says. The economists expect persistently elevated risk premiums in the country. They say, however, that Brazil has a variety of competitive companies \"that are benefiting from secular trends.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1046 ET - The more cautious approach to interest-rate cuts signaled by the Bank of England feels risky, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

         "Deal In Brief",
         "Constantinsborg A/S (Offeror) has decided to make an all-cash voluntary public tender offer all shares in FirstFarms A/S (FirstFarms) (other than own shares held by FirstFarms and shares already held by the Offeror) (the Offer) for a cash price of DKK 84 per share of nominally DKK 10 (the Offer Price). The Offeror is indirectly owned and controlled by Heartland A/S (Heartland) The Offeror will offer DKK 84 for each share of nominally DKK 10, subject to adjustment for any dividends or other distributions declared or paid to the shareholders of FirstFarms prior to completion of the Offer. The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025. The Offer values FirstFarms' entire share capital at approx. DKK 936 million. Further, the Offer Price corresponds at least to the price at which the Offeror is entitled to convert its existing convertible loan and which was determined and negotiated between the Offeror and FirstFarms in connection with the issuance of the loan on 29 February 2024. Completion of the Offer will be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, but completion will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarmsâ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. According to the terms and conditions of the offer document, the Offeror will be entitled to extend the offer period. Following publication of the offer document, all shareholders in FirstFarms (except shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions) will be able to sell their FirstFarms shares to the Offeror during the offer period. FirstFarmsâ board of directors is required to prepare a statement explaining the board's view on the Offer and the reasons forsuch view. The statement must be published before expiry of the first half of the offer period. Because of her relations toConstantinsborg A/S, Lise Kaae will not participate in the preparation of the statement by the board of directors. The Offeror will announce the final results of the Offer no later than three business days after expiry of the offer period (which may be extended) and expects completion of the Offer in Q2 2025. The Offeror has appointed Kromann Reumert as its legal adviser in connection with the Offer.\n\nDeal Type     Acquisition\nSub-Category  100% Acquisition\nDeal Status   Rumour: 2025-02-11\n\n\nDeal Participants\n\nTarget (Company)    FirstFarms A/S\nAcquirer (Company)  Constantinsborg A/S\n\n\nDeal Rationale\n\n% Acquisition  100%\n\n\n(c) 2001-2016 Marketline.

         "*Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable",
         "14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable\n\nThe following is a press release from Fitch Ratings:",
         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

         "* Travel group collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal\n\nEY has been fined Â£4.9million by the Financial Reporting Council for its audits of Thomas Cook in 2017 and 2018.",
         "Thomas Cook collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal, but now operates in the UK as an online-only travel agent.\n\nThe fine was originally Â£6.5million, but was discounted by 25 per cent 'for admissions and early disposal.' EY paid also paid the costs for the investigation.\n\nEY audit engagement partner Richard Wilson was fined Â£140,000, discounted to Â£105,000 for the same reason.\n\nThe FRC imposed sanctions on EY and Wilson over audits for the airline for the financial years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog said the airlineâs goodwill balance was significant, comprising Â£2.6billion across the whole group, roughly 40 per cent of total assets.\n\nThe breaches related to assessing Thomas Cook's goodwill impairment level and going concern status, as well as adequately considering the risk to EY's independence during the 2018 audit, the FRC said.\n\nFollowing an investigation, it was found that for both audit years, EY and Wilson failed to 'approach this audit area with sufficient professional scepticism to properly corroborate managementâs assumptions and estimates supporting the goodwill impairment model'.\n\nThe FRC said 'the failings' for this 'were particularly serious' for 2018 'given Thomas Cookâs deteriorating trading performance, which heightened the risk that the goodwill balance could be impaired.'\n\nClaudia Mortimore, FRC deputy executive counsel, said: 'EY and Mr Wilsonâs failure to challenge robustly and to apply sufficient professional scepticism in these crucial areas led to significant breaches of auditing standards in both audit years.\n\n'The failings in 2018 are particularly serious given Thomas Cookâs financial position and the heightened risks surrounding the audit work.\n\n'EYâs remedial measures together with the programme of non-financial sanctions are designed to prevent such failures being repeated.'\n\nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed in 2019 after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding more than 100,000 passengers overseas and leaving many without jobs.\n\nChinese company Fosun later acquired the company's brand, before selling it to Polish travel platform eSky Group last year.",

         "In early 2025, Igor Mazepa's Concorde Capital bought the oil and gas service company Beiken Energy Ukraine, the Ukrainian subsidiary of the Chinese Beiken, for more than $25 million, Forbes reports.\n\nMazepa plans to provide drilling services both in Ukraine and abroad. The acquired company has 8 drilling rigs and plans to receive $10 million EBITDA for 2025. The lifting capacity of the acquired drilling rigs is from 125 to 450 tons.",
         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "Everton face Bournemouth on Saturday but there is obvious focus on the business they may or may not be able to do in the January transfer window now they have new owners\n\nSean Dyche believes this is the first transfer window heâs had at Everton where he doesnât have to sell to balance the books.",
         "The Toffees boss insists any sales this month will be only if theyâre bringing in a better player. The club was finally taken over by the Friedkin Group last month when the American firm got Premier League approval.\n\nIt follows years of penny pinching when Farhad Moshiriâs wild spending dried up and left the Toffees stuck with financial problems which led to points deductions last season.\n\nThe club has sold star assets like Anthony Gordon, Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana since Dyche arrived two years ago. But now, ahead of todayâs clash at Bournemouth, he insists the only sales happening will be if it is to make room for better players as the new owners bring stability.\n\nâApart from the PSR thing, the stability is there so that has changed,â said Dyche. âThereâs not that need but you still have to work the right market. These guys [TFG] are certainly not wanting to weaken us. Itâs the rules, not the intent.\n\nâWhat youâre saying is kind of right but it [sales] has to make us stronger. We are not under any pressure to get weaker by selling players but what can you do to make us stronger\n\nâThat is the good side of having the stability the owners talked about. We donât need to do anything, that has changed. It is about decision-making. Within the guidelines of the PSR. If we can sell one and bring someone in, that is something we would have to look at.â\n\nRelegation battling Everton, who go to Bournemouth looking for their first win at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League, have yet to have any interest in their current squad this month.\n\nMisfiring forward Beto is one player who may be on the way out if the right offer comes along though as he has struggled to deliver while on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja is now fit to compete with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nâLetâs see what the market offers,â said Dyche. âWe have had no phone-calls, we are making lots of them to see what we can do, see what is around and what can open.\n\nâAt the end of the day, our situation here is that we certainly will not be letting anyone go unless we are needed to. Unless of course we can swap and change. We want to keep the squad, we have had injuries and been very stretched. We are certainly not looking to have players going out.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community \n\nand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Demand from investors covered all the shares offered by Hotelbeds owner HBX Group in its initial public offering within hours, the bookrunner said on Friday, ahead of what is set to be the largest listing in Europe so far this year.\n\nThe Spanish travel technology company said on Thursday it intended to raise 725 million euros ($752.6 million) by selling new shares that would start trading on the Spanish stock market on Feb. 13.",
         "The demand also covered the so-called 'greenshoe option', an additional number of shares potentially offered to investors if demand is strong enough, the bookrunner said on Friday.\n\nThe company has set a price range for its shares between 10.50 euros and 12.50 euros, which would give the whole company a market value of between 2.66 billion euros and 3.03 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations based on the IPO prospectus.\n\nThe private equity-owned company has been planning an IPO for more than a year, Reuters has reported previously, and has recently been sounding out investors.\n\nHBX's shareholders include private equity firms Cinven and EQT, and Canada's CPP Investments. Existing shareholders intend to sell existing shares worth about 25 million euros combined, the company has said.\n\nHBX Group would be the first to launch a European IPO this year after a slight recovery in issuance last year.\n\nThat saw cosmetics and fashion group Puig and private equity fund CVC raising more than 2 billion euros respectively in Madrid and Amsterdam, but Europastry cancelling its market debut due to market instability.\n\n($1 = 0.9633 euros) (Reporting by Inti Landauro, Jesus Aguado and Tomas Cobos, editing by Aislinn Laing and Jan Harvey) ",

         "AJ Bell defends its prices after record profits and share buyback",
         "Investment platform says it is âhighly competitive in the roundâ\n\nAJ Bell insisted its pricing represented good value for money for its clients after it again lifted the amount it takes in interest on their cash balances.",
         "The investment platforms operator reported a 29 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record Â£113.3 million and set out plans for a Â£30 million share buyback.\n\nRevenues grew by 23 per cent to Â£269.4 million on the back of winning a net 66,000 new customers, taking its customer base to 557,000.\n\nThe company said that the net interest it earned from customer balances increased in the year to September, but declined to quantify it, saying that the run rate peaked in March.\n\nMichael Summersgill, chief executive, said the firm was highly competitive looking at âpricing in the roundâ. Interest it pays to customers on their balances ranges from 1.8 per cent for cash in a dealing account up to as much as 4.27 per cent for cash held in some pension accounts.\n\nâWeâre an investment platform. People donât come to us to hold cash,â he said. âWe give great value to our customers.â\n\nInvestment platforms have come under pressure to improve their pricing with the Financial Conduct Authority writing to all of them reminding them of their responsibilities under\n\nthe new consumer duty \n\n.\n\nFor years, platforms made no money on customer balances, with base rate close to zero. But rises in base rate to a high of 5.25 per cent throughout the year to July has delivered them lucrative windfalls. Base rate has since come down to 4.75 per cent.\n\nFavourable market movements during the year added Â£9.5 billion to total assets under management, while net customer inflows of Â£6.1 billion, a rise from Â£4.2 billion last time, pushed the total figure to Â£86.5 million.\n\nSummersgill said successful advertising had helped the group, pushing spontaneous awareness of the brand above 50 per cent from 30 per cent two years ago.\n\nAJ Bell is a Top 3 investment platform business, serving DIY investors directly through its direct-to-customer unit and serving another tranche indirectly through a platform for financial advisers. It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14Â½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. âOver the long term I wouldnât say weâll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.â\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than Â£800,000 a year ago to Â£6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: âThe long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.â\n\nPensions tax âis unworkableâ\n\nThe governmentâs plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bellâs chief executive has said.\n\nâIt is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,â Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: âIf the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,â he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased personâs estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise Â£640 million in 2027-28, Â£1.34 billion in 2028-29 and Â£1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: âMost estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first Â£325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to Â£500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and Â£1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\nâWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.â",

         "PAXMAN has carried out a directed issue of 1.9 million new shares, raising proceeds of SEK 123.5 million",
         "Stockholm: Paxman AB has issued the following news release:\n\nThe Board of Directors of Paxman AB (publ) (\"PAXMAN\" or the \"Company\") has, based on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024 and in accordance with the Company's press release earlier today, resolved on a directed issue of 1,900,000 new shares (the \"Share Issue\"). Through the Share Issue, PAXMAN will receive SEK 123.5 million before issue costs. The subscription price in the Share Issue has been set to SEK 65.0 per share through an accelerated bookbuilding procedure (the \"Bookbuilding\") conducted by Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ). The Share Issue was subscribed by several Swedish and international institutional investors, including Eiffel Investment Group and Unionen, as well as certain existing shareholders, including Alcur Fonder, Andra AP-Fonden, Aktia Asset Management and SEB Asset Management.",
         "As announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. Additionally, the Company has undertaken not to carry out or propose any additional issuances of shares or other securities in the Company, without the consent of Carnegie, for a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. The Company's lock-up undertaking includes an exemption for any consideration shares to be issued in connection with the potential acquisition of Dignitana.\n\nAdvisers\n\nCarnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner in connection with the Share Issue. Advokatfirman Delphi acted as legal adviser to the Company in connection with the Share Issue.",

         "Impending fintech consolidation could yield unprecedented exit values, says Artis Partners; Acquisitions have already become the norm in the payments space, with the wider sector now set to follow suit",
         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 â an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Eliteâs acquisition of Tranch and Neonomicsâ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",
         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: âAn M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. Weâre already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\nâThe key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers â sometimes direct rivals â in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\nâMany of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\nâAs a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months. If founders arenât considering a strategic exit, they could miss out on a prime opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market, and risk losing ground to rivals who stand to benefit from a larger pool of resources through acquisition.â\n\nBasta concluded: âPursuing the funding route will only dilute ownership stakes and reduce overall profitability when the time eventually comes to sell; even more so today since the fundraising market has not come back nearly as strongly as M&A. Itâs time for fintechs to begin the exit planning phase to ensure they remain competitive and take advantage of the industryâs significant momentum.â\n\n-ENDS-\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout Artis Partners\n\nArtis Partners is a boutique investment bank specialising in strategic M&A and fundraising, delivering high exit values for growth stage European and US technology companies.

         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "Nearly two years after the outbreak of the so-called Factop case, the brothers Ariel and Daniel Sauer continue to be the focus of new legal actions by those who claim to be victims of the scheme of false invoices and irregular financing unleashed within the factoring company.\n\nThis Monday, the foreign investment fund \"EMF Microfinance Fund AGmvK\" of the Swiss fund manager Enabling Qapital filed a lawsuit against the brothers and main shareholders of Factop, for the crimes of fraud and forgery, as well as malicious use of a private commercial instrument.",
         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million. To which are added what would have been accrued for the interest rate of 15.6% of the capital owed, \"payable in six installments, of which only one was paid\".",

         "National financial planner The Finli Group has completed its acquisition of Schaefer Financial Management.\n\nIn February this year, Finli - formerly Solomon Capital Holdings - agreed a deal to acquire Schaefer Financial Management in Somerset. The acquisition of MMR Financial Planning which took place in March in Birmingham brings the firm's total acquisitions to 41.",
         "This is its second completed acquisition in two months. Finli said it is on target to complete further deals this month across Kent, Cardiff, Merseyside and Somerset, feeding directly into three of its core regions.\n\nThe firm, which has four regions in total and offices across England, Scotland and Wales, is looking to grow its local presence in Scotland, the north of England, central England and southern regions.\n\nIn January last year, Finli snapped up Scottish IFA Clark Gillone following its previous purchases of Beaufort Group and Gale and Phillipson.\n\nIt aims to add Â£1bn in assets annually and said it is open to speaking to adviser firms of all sizes from Â£25m under advice.\n\nFinli acquisitions director Jon Barham said: \"Acquiring firms often talk about the ideal size of a firm looking to sell.\n\n\"For us, it's about the ideal attitude. If you want to do right by your clients, then we want to talk to you!\"\n\nFinancial planners rank the reputation of acquiring firm above what they'll pay\n\nA recent poll conducted by Finli showed financial planners give greater consideration to the reputation of potential acquirers than they do the sum they are prepared to pay for their business - with 93% strongly agreeing with the statement \"it is paramount that the firm I sell to has a good reputation compared to just 47 per cent who strongly agree with the statement that it is paramount that I am paid a good price\".\n\nFinli said that it is \"never just about the money\" and that there are emotional considerations that need to be given due thought when taking on another financial planner's clients.\n\nThe recently rebranded national said that the narrative around acquiring books of business is \"all too often exclusively focused on the onboarding mechanics and the numbers â the size of each tranche that is to be seeded across each month\".\n\nThe firm asked financial planners what their aspirations were for themselves and their clients when they come to retire.\n\nSome 78% strongly agreed that it is paramount to know that they made a difference in their clients' lives,15% strongly agreed that it is paramount that they can retain a non-advisory relationship with their clients (with a further 32% somewhat agreeing), 95% strongly agree that they want their clients to know the firm they've chosen to take over from them is their parting good 'advice', and 100% strongly agree that they want their clients to feel listened to, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, 80% strongly agree (and 18% somewhat agree) that it is important that the firm that takes over is culturally aligned with their values and those of their clients.\n\n\"Of course, financial planners want to get a good price for their business. And so they should. However, these are businesses that have been built on nurturing relationships, some spanning several decades. So, it should come as no surprise that financial planners place so much importance on the acquiring firm having a good reputation for looking after clients â even that it Top Trumps the sale price,\" said Finli group chief distribution officer Simon Goldthorpe.\n\nGoldthorpe added: \"Of course, they can have both when it's the right fit! However, understanding and, importantly, appreciating that any deal is as much about emotions as it is about the headline figure and the mechanics of the sale is in everyone's best interests. These findings act as a timely reminder of the need to place equal weighting on both.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "The impact of employer NICs hike on M&A valuations",
         "The adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.\n\nThe adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.",
         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: âThe increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

         "There were 588 private equity deals announced or closed in 2024 in Italy. A figure far higher than the one marked in 2023, when 549 deals were mapped (see here BeBeez's Private Equity 2023 Report), in line with the 552 deals in 2022 (see here BeBeez's Private Equity 2022 Report). This is calculated by BeBeez Private Data, BeBeez's private capital database, taking into account both investment and divestment activity and considering not only deals announced by funds, but also those organized by club deals of private investors and investment holding companies. The figure indicates a level of activity never reached since BeBeez began mapping the market.\n\nThat said, only for just under 100 deals was it possible to derive the enterprise value of the target company, accounting for 16.9 percent of total investments and divestments. Among these deals, however, there are some that are very large for the Italian market. Specifically, there are 14 deals (vs. 10 deals in 2023 and 12 in 2022) on companies with EVs greater than EUR 1 billion that involved equity stakes of at least 15 percent and another 13 deals (vs. 8 deals in 2023 and 2022) on companies with EVs of at least EUR 500 million, again for stakes of at least 15 percent.\n\nClick here below to download the report and all the tables mapping deals and investors\n\nReport-PE-EN-2024Download",

         "M&A process a 'disturbing event' for IFAs",
         "The acquisition process can prove a troubling event for staff and owners, experts told PA, but there are ways that buyers and sellers can best manage this.\n\nSpeaking to Professional Adviser, The Flower Group founder Gordon Flower labelled deals \"a disturbing event for IFA owners and the people involved\". Flower added that the acquisition process has \"an emotional toll on everyone involved, particularly those who are being acquired\".",
         "\"People are scared of losing their jobs,\" Flower explained.\n\nThe Flower Group was launched in July 2023 to support the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process for the wealth management sector. Last month (24 January), it unveiled its M&A support service for the wealth management sector, said to \"reduce transaction timelines by an average of six weeks\".\n\nFor those looking to acquire businesses, Flower suggested considering \"good client data\". \"Acquirers like to hear that a business cares about its clients, such as when someone remembers the small things about their clients, rather than viewing their clients as numbers,\" he noted. \"Listening skills are very important in this space.\"\n\nHe added: \"When you're looking to acquire a business, you need to think to yourself, âCan I see this business fit in with us?'\"\n\nFlower noted that many business owners fear losing value during acquisitions. \"They ask themselves, âIs this going to reduce my value?'\" he said.\n\nTo alleviate such concerns, The Flower Group helps prepare sellers for the demands of due diligence and supports acquirers with key insights into the cultural and operational dynamics of their targets.\n\nEnsuring cultural fit and human capital stability\n\nHoxton Wealth founder and CEO Chris Ball highlighted the importance of understanding whether the human capital within the business will remain post-acquisition.\n\n\"Are you buying someone's book that's retiring? If so, then it's important that if they're saying they're retiring, they actually retire,\" Ball explained. \"If they don't have a real reason for retiring, they may find it too difficult and emotional to leave and could return, which creates challenges.\"\n\nHe also stressed the importance of evaluating existing employees before completing the acquisition.\n\n\"If you're keeping the human capital, it's important to meet those people before you buy the business. You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their âbaby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this â often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to Â£3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locationsâsuch as whether employees will work remotely or in an officeâneed to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open â being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation â leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach â communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration â it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being âdone to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer â ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

Aktia stands out by high-quality, personal, and attentive service and comprehensive financial solutions offered to a growing customer base.\n\nProgramme for accelerated strategy implementation\n\nAn acceleration programme is launched to strengthen the implementation of the revised strategic plan and strategic priorities. The objective of the programme is to generate comparable operating profit annualised run rate improvements of approximately EUR 7 million by the end of 2025, and a total of approximately EUR 20 million by the end of 2026 -- aligned with, Aktia's new long-term financial targets. The programme is expected to generate one-off costs, which do not affect the comparable operating result, of approximately EUR 6 million in 2025. The costs relate mainly to external advisory services and are dependent on the financial performance of the programme.\n\n\"Our three strategic priorities are active wealth management, growth in our core segments and a first-class customer experience -- enabled by investments in digital development, streamlining our business processes, and developing the Aktia way of working. A cornerstone of our revised strategic plan is to increase the availability of personal service and wealth management solutions for a wider customer base. We intend to go beyond the established segment borders in the market and democratise private banking services. In this way, we want to give more customers the opportunity to benefit from our award-winning asset management, our peak competence in wealth management and our unique customer experience. With a robust financial basis, a unique market position, skilled employees and an ambitious leadership team, we are well equipped to deliver results and drive profitable growth. I strongly believe in our ability to achieve our new financial targets, especially with the acceleration programme now launched to implement our strategic plan,\" says Aleksi Lehtonen, CEO of Aktia.\n\nAktia's strategic priorities are:\n\n1. Active Wealth Management\n\nAs wealth transitions across generations, customers need accessible, sustainable financial solutions. Aktia helps customers grow and transfer wealth with clear, long-term plans and a holistic approach.\n\n2. Winning in Strategic Segments\n\nFinland's growth relies on bold investments, cross-generational legacies and work, and thriving communities. Aktia takes an active role by driving success in Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutional segments.\n\n3. The Aktia Experience\n\nWe will stand out by specialising in attentive personal service for a growing customer base and by bringing them the Aktia experience. Skilled and committed employees work together to deliver tailored solutions and to respond to the customers' financial needs and goals.\n\nKey enabler: Powered by Data and Technology\n\nEnhancing our IT setup to enable growth in a scalable and efficient way.\n\nLong-term financial targets for 2029: \n\n\n   -- Comparable return on equity (ROE) over 15 per cent by 2029 \n \n   -- Assets under management over EUR 25 billion* by 2029 \n \n   -- Organic net commission income growth over 5 per cent per year \n \n   -- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio 2--4 percentage points above the \n      regulatory requirement. \n\n* This figure reflects gross AuM, corresponding to all AuM in the asset management business for which Aktia receives fee commissions. In the future, Aktia will report both gross and net AuM, rather than only net.\n\nUpdated dividend policy:\n\nAktia's goal is to offer its shareholders a competitive total return, including dividends, the amount of which depends on the Group's profit development as well as growth and investment needs. In addition, Aktia wants to ensure sufficient capital adequacy in changing market circumstances. Aktia's capital and dividend policy has been updated.\n\nUpdated dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, excess capital may be distributed to shareholders using e.g. extra dividends or share buy-backs.\n\n(Previous dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay out a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.)\n\nInvestor Event 27 February 2025:\n\nAktia invites investors, analysts and media representatives to an investor event on 27 February 2025 at 12:30 p.m. During the investor event, CEO Aleksi Lehtonen, together with other members of Aktia's Executive Committee, will present the company's updated strategic priorities and an overview of the acceleration programme for the implementation of the strategic plan with new financial targets.

         "Tallying losses on AIB stake after bank buys back my shares",
         "I received the proceeds of 13 AIB shares, having opted to sell these under the scheme announced by the bank for small shareholders some time back. The shares represent a huge dilution of the original shares which were acquired over many years between the early 1990s and roughly 2007.\n\nWould you know how I would go about calculating the capital loss on these shares in case I need to offset gains somewhere else? Some of the shares may have been acquired by way of scrip dividends, which adds to the complexity.",
         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those â¬13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of â¬73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank. The â¬5.65 a share offer â a 5 per cent premium to the market price â was simply the final insult in an investment that has proven catastrophic over the past 14 years.\n\nThose 250 shares that would have been worth â¬17.50 just before the consolidation announcement, and â¬8.75 on the last day the old shares traded on December 18th, became a single share which was worth â¬8.50 at the close of trading on December 21st. However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of â¬6,000 â â¬5,987.50 to be precise â at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way. At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of â¬78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares â shares given in lieu of cash dividends â the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the â¬18.98 a share the bankâs stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the â¬5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. Thatâs 2.26 cent. So your loss on that dayâs trade is almost â¬18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records â or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares â for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, youâll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYouâre talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain â because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price â for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

         "*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

         "BRITISH Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) is poised to finalise its acquisition of JN General Insurance (JNGI) imminently, a move that will significantly reshape Jamaicaâs general insurance market. JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaicaâs general insurance sector.",
         "Earl Jarrett, CEO of the Jamaica National Group (JN Group), made the disclosure to staff earlier this week.\n\nâThe JN Financial Group will sign an agreement today for British Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) to purchase its shares in JN General Insurance (JNGI),â Jarrett wrote in a note circulated to staff on Monday. The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms. But those negotiations are continuing,â Levy added.\n\nJNGI will continue to renew motor and property insurance through its branches and brokers as well as honour insurance claims until the sale is finalised.\n\nâOnce the sale is finalised, the JNGI portfolio, business, and locations will be fully managed by BCIC. All positions within JNGI will be made redundant; however, some JNGI employees will be invited to explore opportunities within BCIC,â Jarrettâs e-mail said.\n\nIt noted that JNGI employees and the National Workersâ Union, the bargaining entity that represents the workers, have been kept informed of the planned sale, adding that dialogue is ongoing regarding the future of the employees.\n\nLevy said he didnât know how many of the JNGI staff will be given positions at BCIC.\n\nâWell, a lot of the work weâll be doing once we sign the deal will be around filling out those details. So, at the current time, we donât really know,â Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\nâThe analysis that weâve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,â Levy said. âInsurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I donât think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.â\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCICâs position as one of the leading players in Jamaicaâs general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "BRITISH Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) is poised to finalise its acquisition of JN General Insurance (JNGI) imminently, a move that will significantly reshape Jamaicaâs general insurance market. JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaicaâs general insurance sector.",
         "Earl Jarrett, CEO of the Jamaica National Group (JN Group), made the disclosure to staff earlier this week.\n\nâThe JN Financial Group will sign an agreement today for British Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) to purchase its shares in JN General Insurance (JNGI),â Jarrett wrote in a note circulated to staff on Monday. The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the agreement âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms. But those negotiations are continuing,â Levy added.\n\nJNGI will continue to renew motor and property insurance through its branches and brokers as well as honour insurance claims until the sale is finalised.\n\nâOnce the sale is finalised, the JNGI portfolio, business, and locations will be fully managed by BCIC. All positions within JNGI will be made redundant; however, some JNGI employees will be invited to explore opportunities within BCIC,â Jarrettâs e-mail said.\n\nIt noted that JNGI employees and the National Workersâ Union, the bargaining entity that represents the workers, have been kept informed of the planned sale, adding that dialogue is ongoing regarding the future of the employees.\n\nLevy said he didnât know how many of the JNGI staff will be given positions at BCIC.\n\nâWell, a lot of the work weâll be doing once we sign the deal will be around filling out those details. So, at the current time, we donât really know,â Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\nâThe analysis that weâve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,â Levy said. âInsurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I donât think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.â\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCICâs position as one of the leading players in Jamaicaâs general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "The National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) has accepted one of Banc Sabadell's demands and will open the market test it is finalizing regarding BBVA's takeover bid for the Catalan bank to both business associations and trade unions, according to industry sources.\n\nThis was one of the requests of Sabadell's chairman, Josep Oliu, who has even compared the lack of participation of these agents in the market test to \"asking the fox if he wants the hens to run free\".",
         "During the in-depth analysis of the operation, known as phase two, the CNMC rejected the allegations of 79 associations and only accepted that of Sabadell, considering that it is the only one with a legitimate interest. Two of the organizations that submitted allegations, Foment del Treball and UGT, have filed appeals before the National Court, both of which have been admitted for processing.\n\nThe market test has not yet been launched, but some associations have already been informed that they will be taken into account. By opening the procedure, they will at least have the opportunity to express their opinion during this process on an operation which, they say, limits competition, especially in the SME business, and puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStructural conditions of conductThe market test is being launched after the agreement of commitments between BBVA and the CNMC, in which the behavioral guidelines set out by the opting bank are maintained, mainly related to measures such as maintaining branches except those that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters and commercial conditions for customers for a certain period.\n\nThe CNMC accepts BBVA's approach, although tightening the time commitments, which in some aspects go up to three years. This is a different approach to that advocated by Sabadell, which calls for structural measures and asks that the market test itself should ask the sector whether BBVA should sell assets in order to maintain competition.\n\nOnce the test has been launched, the sector's agents will have ten working days to reply, after which the CNMC's Competition Directorate will submit the final report to the plenary for approval of the opinion.\n\nIt is at that moment when the Ministry of Economy will have 15 days to decide whether to analyze the file and, within 30 additional days, submit it to the Council of Ministers, which may establish additional conditions to BBVA.\n\nBBVA is confident that it will be able to launch the takeover bid in June, although the next few days will be key to determine the speed of the process and whether, given the holiday break, the operation will be postponed until after August.",

         "ING's role (past, present and future) in BBVA's takeover bid for Sabadell",
         "ING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.\n\nThe entity has been very explicit in recognizing that it wants to grow in markets such as Spain, much more than what banks usually do before carrying out relevant operations. \"We want to grow in larger markets, such as Italy, Spain and Germany,\" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in early February. \"M&A is an option everywhere, if it fits our criteria,\" he added.",
         "Spain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio JuliÃ¡, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena RomÃ¡n as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena RomÃ¡n returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put RomÃ¡n in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique PiÃ±el as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

         "British Virgin Islands: Special Purpose Vehicles For Luxury Assets",
         "For family offices, high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) considering the purchase of luxury assets (in particular yachts, artworks and aircraft) there are multiple factors to consider, not least deciding on the optimum structure to purchase and hold such luxury assets.\n\nWhen purchasing a luxury asset, one of the first considerations should be the structure through which such luxury asset will be purchased and subsequently held. One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",
         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured âoff balance sheetâ and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from âlimited liability recourseâ meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise, currently not available to the general public.\n\nTax Neutrality: The BVI is tax neutral meaning that there is no income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax levied in the BVI. In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper InformaciÃ³n in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",
         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide. The shareholder is king, just as everyone is king with their own property. When you want to sell your house, it is up to you to decide whether to sell it or not. Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del MediterrÃ¡neo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "BBVA defends the takeover bid for Sabadell: \"We do not expect the Government to impose a veto on the operation\".",
         "The Chairman and CEO of BBVA, Carlos Torres, expressed his satisfaction with BBVA's record annual profits, above 10,000 million euros, thanks to the improvement in all markets and business areas. This was another reason for him to defend the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, about which he commented that \"Europe needs larger banks to be able to make the necessary investments to maintain a sustainable position for the future. This operation gives us the opportunity to have more than 5,000 million in financing, which means paying more taxes, a greater global reach based on meritocracy and the creation of value for shareholders that the operation entails. Together we can achieve greater goals that would be impossible to achieve separately.",
         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at TelefÃ³nica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Ãlvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in TelefÃ³nica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the â¬0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of â¬0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate â¬5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents â¬0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa GÃ³mez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, GÃ³mez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

         "Smaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.\n\nSmaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.",
         "Jeffreys told FT Adviser she expected more changes to happen within the M&A market in the coming 12 months - and it would be the acquirers and consolidators themselves who might consolidate.\n\nShe said: âMany PE-backed acquirers took investment in 2019, so the PE houses will be on a countdown to exit their positions, and a wave of transactions is likely.\n\nâThe number of new entrant buyers at that point in time (approximately 15 firms) left many buyers competing over the same targets. As a result, most have not achieved the scale expected by their backers at this stage.\n\nâMergers will give the PE houses the opportunity to exit their positions with more scale and see a new set of investors into the market.â\n\n'We will walk away from a deal': how consolidators have become 'picky'\n\nJeffreys believed there would be three key themes that would dominate the M&A landscape in 2025, with the first being the number of firms coming to market.\n\nâThe buyer market is extensive â it is broad and deep and made up of a mix of firms seeking different outcomes from acquisitive growth.\n\nâThe market can absolutely support an uptick in firms for sale. However, there will be increased competition over the highest quality, and the risk that other firms fail to attract significant interest.\n\nâFurthermore, there is a risk a bottle-neck could occur in the FCAâs change in the team approving company sales. During Covid, we saw significant delays to deals due to the CIC taking significantly longer than anticipated, and if this happens again it may mean sellers looking to beat tax hike deadlines will not succeed.\n\nâIt could also lead to poor behaviour reported pre-budget, where it was rumoured some sales were going through without the necessary regulatory approvals,â she explained.\n\nJeffreys also predicted buyers would be putting significant focus on the integration of the firms they buy.\n\nIf supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted. Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the âbuy & buildâ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\nâThe consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\nâMany of the âbuy & buildâ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\nâThat further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.â\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labourâs first Budget for 14 years has had a âhuge impactâ on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\nâBADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\nâIt could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\nâFurthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale â potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,â she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

         "The acquisition of firms is a common practice in the consulting sector, with recent examples among the Big Four and large technology companies, such as EY with the purchase of Attalea Partners, Deloitte acquiring Keytree or Accenture integrating Axis Corporate. Although this approach is not usually the main driver of growth for these companies, there are already international firms such as McKinsey that are showing more and more interest in this type of strategy. In this scenario, Jungle, despite being significantly smaller than these large consulting firms, is positioned as one of the few firms that bases its growth strategy on a programmatic M&A, with the goal of acquiring up to four firms a year.",
         "This Spanish company, which is listed on the French market, but is considering listing in Spain next year, recently closed its fourth annual purchase, with the acquisition of Move Branding, which joins the other three consulting firms acquired this year: the technology firm MilÃº, the creative agency BUM and Liquid Lab, a technology consulting firm owned by the former CEO of Mobile World Capital Barcelona.\n\nBoth in this last acquisition and in the other 10 that Jungle intends to make from 2025 onwards, it is relying on the advice of Grant Thornton and the GÃ³mez Acebo law firm. In addition, for these future acquisitions, the consulting firm will allocate 40 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the company, led by AgustÃ­n Vivancos, has its own M&A department led by a creative person with a financial profile. This team analyzes a portfolio of almost 300 companies per year, of which they contact about 100 and end up negotiating with three dozen of them. Some of these acquired companies end up becoming spin-offs, as is the case of True, Meme or Libero Creative Club, specialized in soccer.\n\nSince 2022, the consulting firm has already added a dozen new acquisitions. With the constant growth in size, Jungle faces the challenge of acquiring larger and larger companies, which implies more significant investments.\n\nThe company expects to close 2024 with a turnover of $40 million To ensure the profitability of these operations, the firm uses a growth and integration methodology based on three fundamental pillars: 1,000-day strategic planning, weekly accountability and management focused on a maximum of three KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, Jungle recordedtotal revenues of â¬27.2 million, a 49% growth compared to the previous year.

The company's major products and services include:\n\nProducts:\n\nTreaty Reinsurance\n\nLife Reinsurance\n\nMedical Reinsurance\n\nProperty Reinsurance\n\nCasualty Reinsurance\n\nEngineering Reinsurance\n\nGeneral Accident Reinsurance\n\nMarine Liabilities Reinsurance\n\nMarine Hull Reinsurance\n\nCargo Reinsurance\n\nServices:\n\nRisk Management\n\nClaims Payment\n\nAccount Handling\n\nArab Insurance Group (ARIG) is a provider of life and non-life reinsurance products and services. Solvency position, broad product portfolio and investment income status are the key strengths of the company, even as its premium earnings remain causes for concern. A short-term economic outlook of Bahrain, a positive outlook for the non-life insurance segment in Bahrain and UAE, could provide ample growth opportunities for the company. However, risks related to online identity theft and hacking, fluctuations in interest rates, and intense competition could affect the companyâs business performance.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nSolvency\n\nInvestment Income\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nARIGâs broad product portfolio enables it to enhance its scalability to cater to the distinctive requirements of its clientele. The company offers a range of non-life and life reinsurance products and services across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Its portfolio of reinsurance products includes treaty reinsurance, life reinsurance, medical reinsurance, and property reinsurance. It also offers facultative reinsurance for specialty lines, such as casualty, engineering, marine hull, cargo, marine liabilities, and motor extended warranty. ARIGâs services include risk management, account handling, and claims payment services.\n\nSolvency\n\nSound solvency of the company strengthens its ability to borrow and repay the money, which in turn enhances its business operations. According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The companyâs insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloydâs portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrainâs GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the companyâs profitability. The companyâs investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the companyâs control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the companyâs operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the companyâs operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the companyâs portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Companyâs 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: á´ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. á´ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. á´ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company â¢ While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor âGulf Tamin Ltdâ was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. â¢ The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. â¢ As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Companyâs Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. â¢ The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholdersâ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the companyâs paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the companyâs shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIGâS REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIGâS INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, companyâs funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Directors further extend their thanks to our business partners, clients, staff and shareholders for their support and cooperation throughout the year.\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\n2 Shenton Way\n\n#13-02, SGX Centre 1\n\nSingapore City\n\nSGP\n\n65 65366618\n\n65 65366619\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nBrighton Place\n\nGround Floor, Shoplot No. U0215\n\nJalan Bahasa\n\nLabuan\n\nLabuan (Federal Territory of)\n\nMYS\n\n60 87 442899\n\n60 87 451899\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nUnit 12C, 12th Floor Raffles Tower\n\n19 Cybercity\n\nEbene\n\nMUS\n\n230 466 0112\n\n230 466 0114\n\nArig Capital Limited\n\n4th Floor\n\nMitre House\n\n12 14 Mitre Street\n\nGBR\n\n44 20 3207 0081\n\nGulf Warranties W.L.L\n\nPO Box 5209\n\nDubai\n\nBHR\n\n973 4 3355347\n\n973 4 3355679\n\nwww.gulfwarranties.com\n\nTakaful Re Limited\n\nDIFC, Dubai International Financial Centre\n\nThe gate district, Precinct building 3, level 4, Tenancy 3\n\nP.O.

         "* Barnes & Noble plans to open around 60 new stores in the US, says CEO James Daunt.\n\n* Daunt said it would be \"logical\" to consider a future initial public offering in London or New York.",
         "* Barnes & Noble was acquired by Elliott Investment Management for $683 million in 2019.\n\nJames Daunt, the CEO of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, said he would open about 60 new stores in the US.\n\nThe British bookseller boss told the Financial Times that he is considering a future initial public offering in London or New York as well as the expansion.\n\nThroughout 2024, 57 Barnes & Noble locations were opened across the US, which currently has approximately 600 stores. In the UK, 12 new stores were added. Speaking about additions in the new year, Daunt said to the FT that he plans to \"do that or more in 2025.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest book chain in America. After he quit his investment banking job, Daunt launched Daunt Books in London in 1990 â where there are now about 10 stores. In 2011, he was appointed managing director of British bookseller Waterstones to help the struggling business, which faced growing competition from Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Waterstones was sold to Elliott Investment Management by Russian billionaire and publisher Alexander Mamut. Barnes & Noble was acquired by the same New York-headquartered hedge fund the following year for $683 million.\n\nDaunt was named CEO of both book retailers. He also continues to run his independent book chain in London.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble and Waterstones boss told the FT it would be \"logical\" to contemplate an IPO but that any plan would be based on Elliott's strategy for the future. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the FT reported there are no current plans to list the chains. However, it could be a possibility at a later stage.\n\nAt present, Daunt hopes to combine the IT and finance platforms at Barnes & Noble and Waterstones into one system.\n\nHe noted that it was a \"solid Christmas\" because as the holiday fell on a Wednesday, last-minute shoppers had the weekend before to purchase gifts.\n\n\"The last weekend and [December] 23-24 were exceptional on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he told the FT. \"It has been a good post-Christmas as well.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

         "5 Red Flags to Watch Out for in Small Business Acquisitions",
         "Recognize the warning signs to help avoid costly mistakes in your next merger or acquisition.\n\nNatalia Tkachenko-Horbachevska, an Entrepreneursâ Organization (EO) member in Ukraine, is the founder and CEO of Task Force language services, which CSA Research 2024 ranked in the TOP 5 fastest-growing language services companies globally. From her offices in Poland and Ukraine, Tkachenko-Horbachevska shared her U.S. growth strategy journey, which includes a lesson on mergers and acquisitions.",
         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. Youâre ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.âbut canât quite find the time because thereâs already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And thenâwar breaks out in your country.\n\nThatâs what happened to my company. I work in the field of language servicesâtranslations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldnât be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work. Peopleâs immediate concerns were fuel (to flee), food, and medicine.\n\nThe strategy of âclaiming more local market shareâ seemed irrelevantâI thought there would be no market left to claim. Thankfully, I was wrong, and we continue to work actively in Ukraine. I was in despair for the first two days of the war but then decided that despair is not productive, so I put all my energy into work.\n\nThus, in early 2022, we made a 180-degree shift. We chose Poland as our new home market. It was the only growing economy in Europe, close to Ukraine, and provided an inroad to the European market. From there, we could both help our fellow Ukrainian businesspeople and expand internationally. Poland would become our launchpad for selling services worldwide.\n\nWe needed to âlocalizeâ ourselves in Europe. Ukraine is its own world, and Europeâthe EU in particularâis another, with its own rules we had yet to learn. Our goal was to âbecome part ofâ Europe.\n\nThe fastest, most logical solution was to acquire a company. We explored potential targets in Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didnât have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, âIt doesnât matter when the client buysânow or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,â it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a companyâs sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, âIt seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I donât really track that.â The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performedâall data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the companyâs direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, itâs critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didnât have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Ownerâs resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasnât appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we havenât lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europeâyet.\n\nClick to view image.",

In a short statement, Retelit said the assets included in the transaction generated revenues of around EUR 160 million in 2024, without disclosing the financial terms agreed upon.\n\nThe B2B specialist did specify that the acquisition would serve to enhance its proprietary fibre-optic network by an additional 11,500 km to over 47,000 km, while adding a further 10 MW of power capacity to its national data centre infrastructure. It would also boost its suite of ICT infrastructure and services to support the innovation and the digital transformation of Italian businesses.",
         "The deal, which is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, will also result in over 360 existing domestic business clients of BT in Italy transitioning to Retelit. In 2023, the company acquired regional fibre operator BT Enia from BT Italia to boost its fibre and data centre footprint in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nBT has been looking to withdraw from Italy since booking a GBP 530 million charge in 2017 following a false accounting scandal, subsequently selling two business units to TIM in 2021.",

         "France's InVivo seeks Ukraine silos for postwar grain trading push",
         "PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - French agriculture firm InVivo is looking to acquire silos at Ukraine's Odesa port to bolster its global trading business and refocus on its cereal activities, its chief executive told Reuters.\n\nDespite massive destruction since Russia's invasion, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest grain exporters via its Black Sea ports in the Odesa region.",
         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processing,\" Blandinieres said.\n\nThat includes Soufflet Malt, one of the world's biggest producers of the barley-based beer and whisky ingredient.\n\nThe unit on Friday announced a 100 million euro investment to build a malt factory in South Africa with Heineken.\n\n($1 = 0.9161 euros) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Sybille de La Hamaide) ",

         "Spain is planning to introduce a 100% tax on the value of properties purchased by people who are not from the European Union (EU).\n\nSpanish prime minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the move would help address the country's housing shortage, the BBC reported.",
         "He said non-EU residents bought 27,000 Spanish properties in 2023 with many destined for the rental market.\n\nPre-election soundbite?\n\nSeila Sanches Lucas is a UK and Spanish-qualified lawyer at the international law firm Broadfield who helps clients buy and sell property in Spain.\n\nShe said: \"The proposal by the Spanish prime minister will be concerning for those that have already chosen to retire in Spain and for those considering a retirement in the sun.\n\n\"It is just a proposal at this point in time and is not guaranteed to make it onto the Spanish statute books.\n\n\"It would be interesting to know whether this proposal would extend to the entire country or to particularly regions. UK nationals who have already retired and living in Spain will also want to know whether this tax could be levied retrospectively.\"\n\nShe added: \"It should be noted that some consider the Spanish prime minister is politically vulnerable and this may simply be a pre-election soundbite to boost his popularity. Even if adopted, the legislative process in Spain is tortiously slow and it is perhaps a little early for UK nationals to worry about this proposal.\n\n\"If adopted, there are many other jurisdictions looking to attract wealthy retirees and investors. For example, Dubai has been called the âNew Marbella'.\"\n\nSpain has already set a date to close its so-called \"golden\" investor visa set up from 3 April this year. The visa previously gave foreign investors fast-tracked residency but will now be scrapped.\n\nFragomen is an immigration specialist law firm. Director Isobel Neilson said closing of the investor visa will be a \"huge blow for retirees from the UK looking to move to Spain\".\n\n\"They will now have to look to other passive routes to obtain residency such as the non-lucrative visa â this is unfortunately less flexible, does not allow the applicant to work (even remotely) in Spain and requires full-time residency (six months a year) to maintain the status.\n\n\"One of the requirements of this visa is that the applicant needs to evidence accommodation in Spain. This can either be through a lease or showing title deeds to a property in Spain.\n\n\"If the proposed 100% tax on homeownership for non-EU nationals were to be introduced our clients would most likely look to rent instead of buying or alternatively explore other more favourable EU jurisdictions offering similar status such as the D7 visa in Portugal or the elective residency permit in Italy.\"\n\nRead more: Retiring abroad: Helping clients get their place in the sun\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",
         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Gold currently trades 1.8% lower at $2,604.50 a troy ounce, with investors now waiting for U.S. PCE inflation data due on Friday. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n\n1104 ET - Brazilian assets are undervalued, \"but it will be challenging to reverse this negative trend,\" Santader economists write. The country faces a worsening fiscal situation, rising inflation and steep borrowing costs. The currency has lost 27% of its dollar value this year and the Ibovespa stock index is down nearly 10%. \"Local institutional clients are preparing for potential outflows by building up cash reserves, and foreign investors are also hesitant,\" Santander says. The economists expect persistently elevated risk premiums in the country. They say, however, that Brazil has a variety of competitive companies \"that are benefiting from secular trends.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1046 ET - The more cautious approach to interest-rate cuts signaled by the Bank of England feels risky, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025. The Offer values FirstFarms' entire share capital at approx. DKK 936 million. Further, the Offer Price corresponds at least to the price at which the Offeror is entitled to convert its existing convertible loan and which was determined and negotiated between the Offeror and FirstFarms in connection with the issuance of the loan on 29 February 2024. Completion of the Offer will be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, but completion will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarmsâ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. According to the terms and conditions of the offer document, the Offeror will be entitled to extend the offer period. Following publication of the offer document, all shareholders in FirstFarms (except shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions) will be able to sell their FirstFarms shares to the Offeror during the offer period. FirstFarmsâ board of directors is required to prepare a statement explaining the board's view on the Offer and the reasons forsuch view. The statement must be published before expiry of the first half of the offer period. Because of her relations toConstantinsborg A/S, Lise Kaae will not participate in the preparation of the statement by the board of directors. The Offeror will announce the final results of the Offer no later than three business days after expiry of the offer period (which may be extended) and expects completion of the Offer in Q2 2025. The Offeror has appointed Kromann Reumert as its legal adviser in connection with the Offer.\n\nDeal Type     Acquisition\nSub-Category  100% Acquisition\nDeal Status   Rumour: 2025-02-11\n\n\nDeal Participants\n\nTarget (Company)    FirstFarms A/S\nAcquirer (Company)  Constantinsborg A/S\n\n\nDeal Rationale\n\n% Acquisition  100%\n\n\n(c) 2001-2016 Marketline.

         "*Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable",
         "14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable\n\nThe following is a press release from Fitch Ratings:",
         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

         "* Travel group collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal\n\nEY has been fined Â£4.9million by the Financial Reporting Council for its audits of Thomas Cook in 2017 and 2018.",
         "Thomas Cook collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal, but now operates in the UK as an online-only travel agent.\n\nThe fine was originally Â£6.5million, but was discounted by 25 per cent 'for admissions and early disposal.' EY paid also paid the costs for the investigation.\n\nEY audit engagement partner Richard Wilson was fined Â£140,000, discounted to Â£105,000 for the same reason.\n\nThe FRC imposed sanctions on EY and Wilson over audits for the airline for the financial years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog said the airlineâs goodwill balance was significant, comprising Â£2.6billion across the whole group, roughly 40 per cent of total assets.\n\nThe breaches related to assessing Thomas Cook's goodwill impairment level and going concern status, as well as adequately considering the risk to EY's independence during the 2018 audit, the FRC said.\n\nFollowing an investigation, it was found that for both audit years, EY and Wilson failed to 'approach this audit area with sufficient professional scepticism to properly corroborate managementâs assumptions and estimates supporting the goodwill impairment model'.\n\nThe FRC said 'the failings' for this 'were particularly serious' for 2018 'given Thomas Cookâs deteriorating trading performance, which heightened the risk that the goodwill balance could be impaired.'\n\nClaudia Mortimore, FRC deputy executive counsel, said: 'EY and Mr Wilsonâs failure to challenge robustly and to apply sufficient professional scepticism in these crucial areas led to significant breaches of auditing standards in both audit years.\n\n'The failings in 2018 are particularly serious given Thomas Cookâs financial position and the heightened risks surrounding the audit work.\n\n'EYâs remedial measures together with the programme of non-financial sanctions are designed to prevent such failures being repeated.'\n\nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed in 2019 after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding more than 100,000 passengers overseas and leaving many without jobs.\n\nChinese company Fosun later acquired the company's brand, before selling it to Polish travel platform eSky Group last year.",

         "In early 2025, Igor Mazepa's Concorde Capital bought the oil and gas service company Beiken Energy Ukraine, the Ukrainian subsidiary of the Chinese Beiken, for more than $25 million, Forbes reports.\n\nMazepa plans to provide drilling services both in Ukraine and abroad. The acquired company has 8 drilling rigs and plans to receive $10 million EBITDA for 2025. The lifting capacity of the acquired drilling rigs is from 125 to 450 tons.",
         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "Everton face Bournemouth on Saturday but there is obvious focus on the business they may or may not be able to do in the January transfer window now they have new owners\n\nSean Dyche believes this is the first transfer window heâs had at Everton where he doesnât have to sell to balance the books.",
         "The Toffees boss insists any sales this month will be only if theyâre bringing in a better player. The club was finally taken over by the Friedkin Group last month when the American firm got Premier League approval.\n\nIt follows years of penny pinching when Farhad Moshiriâs wild spending dried up and left the Toffees stuck with financial problems which led to points deductions last season.\n\nThe club has sold star assets like Anthony Gordon, Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana since Dyche arrived two years ago. But now, ahead of todayâs clash at Bournemouth, he insists the only sales happening will be if it is to make room for better players as the new owners bring stability.\n\nâApart from the PSR thing, the stability is there so that has changed,â said Dyche. âThereâs not that need but you still have to work the right market. These guys [TFG] are certainly not wanting to weaken us. Itâs the rules, not the intent.\n\nâWhat youâre saying is kind of right but it [sales] has to make us stronger. We are not under any pressure to get weaker by selling players but what can you do to make us stronger\n\nâThat is the good side of having the stability the owners talked about. We donât need to do anything, that has changed. It is about decision-making. Within the guidelines of the PSR. If we can sell one and bring someone in, that is something we would have to look at.â\n\nRelegation battling Everton, who go to Bournemouth looking for their first win at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League, have yet to have any interest in their current squad this month.\n\nMisfiring forward Beto is one player who may be on the way out if the right offer comes along though as he has struggled to deliver while on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja is now fit to compete with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nâLetâs see what the market offers,â said Dyche. âWe have had no phone-calls, we are making lots of them to see what we can do, see what is around and what can open.\n\nâAt the end of the day, our situation here is that we certainly will not be letting anyone go unless we are needed to. Unless of course we can swap and change. We want to keep the squad, we have had injuries and been very stretched. We are certainly not looking to have players going out.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community \n\nand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "The demand also covered the so-called 'greenshoe option', an additional number of shares potentially offered to investors if demand is strong enough, the bookrunner said on Friday.\n\nThe company has set a price range for its shares between 10.50 euros and 12.50 euros, which would give the whole company a market value of between 2.66 billion euros and 3.03 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations based on the IPO prospectus.\n\nThe private equity-owned company has been planning an IPO for more than a year, Reuters has reported previously, and has recently been sounding out investors.\n\nHBX's shareholders include private equity firms Cinven and EQT, and Canada's CPP Investments. Existing shareholders intend to sell existing shares worth about 25 million euros combined, the company has said.\n\nHBX Group would be the first to launch a European IPO this year after a slight recovery in issuance last year.\n\nThat saw cosmetics and fashion group Puig and private equity fund CVC raising more than 2 billion euros respectively in Madrid and Amsterdam, but Europastry cancelling its market debut due to market instability.\n\n($1 = 0.9633 euros) (Reporting by Inti Landauro, Jesus Aguado and Tomas Cobos, editing by Aislinn Laing and Jan Harvey) ",

         "Investment platform says it is âhighly competitive in the roundâ\n\nAJ Bell insisted its pricing represented good value for money for its clients after it again lifted the amount it takes in interest on their cash balances.",
         "The investment platforms operator reported a 29 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record Â£113.3 million and set out plans for a Â£30 million share buyback.\n\nRevenues grew by 23 per cent to Â£269.4 million on the back of winning a net 66,000 new customers, taking its customer base to 557,000.\n\nThe company said that the net interest it earned from customer balances increased in the year to September, but declined to quantify it, saying that the run rate peaked in March.\n\nMichael Summersgill, chief executive, said the firm was highly competitive looking at âpricing in the roundâ. Interest it pays to customers on their balances ranges from 1.8 per cent for cash in a dealing account up to as much as 4.27 per cent for cash held in some pension accounts.\n\nâWeâre an investment platform. People donât come to us to hold cash,â he said. âWe give great value to our customers.â\n\nInvestment platforms have come under pressure to improve their pricing with the Financial Conduct Authority writing to all of them reminding them of their responsibilities under\n\nthe new consumer duty \n\n.\n\nFor years, platforms made no money on customer balances, with base rate close to zero. But rises in base rate to a high of 5.25 per cent throughout the year to July has delivered them lucrative windfalls. Base rate has since come down to 4.75 per cent.\n\nFavourable market movements during the year added Â£9.5 billion to total assets under management, while net customer inflows of Â£6.1 billion, a rise from Â£4.2 billion last time, pushed the total figure to Â£86.5 million.\n\nSummersgill said successful advertising had helped the group, pushing spontaneous awareness of the brand above 50 per cent from 30 per cent two years ago.\n\nAJ Bell is a Top 3 investment platform business, serving DIY investors directly through its direct-to-customer unit and serving another tranche indirectly through a platform for financial advisers. It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14Â½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. âOver the long term I wouldnât say weâll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.â\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than Â£800,000 a year ago to Â£6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: âThe long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.â\n\nPensions tax âis unworkableâ\n\nThe governmentâs plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bellâs chief executive has said.\n\nâIt is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,â Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: âIf the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,â he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased personâs estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise Â£640 million in 2027-28, Â£1.34 billion in 2028-29 and Â£1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: âMost estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first Â£325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to Â£500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and Â£1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\nâWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.â",

         "PAXMAN has carried out a directed issue of 1.9 million new shares, raising proceeds of SEK 123.5 million",
         "Stockholm: Paxman AB has issued the following news release:\n\nThe Board of Directors of Paxman AB (publ) (\"PAXMAN\" or the \"Company\") has, based on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024 and in accordance with the Company's press release earlier today, resolved on a directed issue of 1,900,000 new shares (the \"Share Issue\"). Through the Share Issue, PAXMAN will receive SEK 123.5 million before issue costs. The subscription price in the Share Issue has been set to SEK 65.0 per share through an accelerated bookbuilding procedure (the \"Bookbuilding\") conducted by Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ). The Share Issue was subscribed by several Swedish and international institutional investors, including Eiffel Investment Group and Unionen, as well as certain existing shareholders, including Alcur Fonder, Andra AP-Fonden, Aktia Asset Management and SEB Asset Management.",
         "As announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. Additionally, the Company has undertaken not to carry out or propose any additional issuances of shares or other securities in the Company, without the consent of Carnegie, for a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. The Company's lock-up undertaking includes an exemption for any consideration shares to be issued in connection with the potential acquisition of Dignitana.\n\nAdvisers\n\nCarnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner in connection with the Share Issue. Advokatfirman Delphi acted as legal adviser to the Company in connection with the Share Issue.",

         "Impending fintech consolidation could yield unprecedented exit values, says Artis Partners; Acquisitions have already become the norm in the payments space, with the wider sector now set to follow suit",
         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 â an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Eliteâs acquisition of Tranch and Neonomicsâ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",
         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: âAn M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. Weâre already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\nâThe key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers â sometimes direct rivals â in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\nâMany of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\nâAs a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months. If founders arenât considering a strategic exit, they could miss out on a prime opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market, and risk losing ground to rivals who stand to benefit from a larger pool of resources through acquisition.â\n\nBasta concluded: âPursuing the funding route will only dilute ownership stakes and reduce overall profitability when the time eventually comes to sell; even more so today since the fundraising market has not come back nearly as strongly as M&A. Itâs time for fintechs to begin the exit planning phase to ensure they remain competitive and take advantage of the industryâs significant momentum.â\n\n-ENDS-\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout Artis Partners\n\nArtis Partners is a boutique investment bank specialising in strategic M&A and fundraising, delivering high exit values for growth stage European and US technology companies.

         "UK's private share trading plan will be a flop, says buyout veteran Jon Moulton; Pisces has come under criticism in recent weeks",
         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "Nearly two years after the outbreak of the so-called Factop case, the brothers Ariel and Daniel Sauer continue to be the focus of new legal actions by those who claim to be victims of the scheme of false invoices and irregular financing unleashed within the factoring company.\n\nThis Monday, the foreign investment fund \"EMF Microfinance Fund AGmvK\" of the Swiss fund manager Enabling Qapital filed a lawsuit against the brothers and main shareholders of Factop, for the crimes of fraud and forgery, as well as malicious use of a private commercial instrument.",
         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million. To which are added what would have been accrued for the interest rate of 15.6% of the capital owed, \"payable in six installments, of which only one was paid\".",

         "National financial planner The Finli Group has completed its acquisition of Schaefer Financial Management.\n\nIn February this year, Finli - formerly Solomon Capital Holdings - agreed a deal to acquire Schaefer Financial Management in Somerset. The acquisition of MMR Financial Planning which took place in March in Birmingham brings the firm's total acquisitions to 41.",
         "This is its second completed acquisition in two months. Finli said it is on target to complete further deals this month across Kent, Cardiff, Merseyside and Somerset, feeding directly into three of its core regions.\n\nThe firm, which has four regions in total and offices across England, Scotland and Wales, is looking to grow its local presence in Scotland, the north of England, central England and southern regions.\n\nIn January last year, Finli snapped up Scottish IFA Clark Gillone following its previous purchases of Beaufort Group and Gale and Phillipson.\n\nIt aims to add Â£1bn in assets annually and said it is open to speaking to adviser firms of all sizes from Â£25m under advice.\n\nFinli acquisitions director Jon Barham said: \"Acquiring firms often talk about the ideal size of a firm looking to sell.\n\n\"For us, it's about the ideal attitude. If you want to do right by your clients, then we want to talk to you!\"\n\nFinancial planners rank the reputation of acquiring firm above what they'll pay\n\nA recent poll conducted by Finli showed financial planners give greater consideration to the reputation of potential acquirers than they do the sum they are prepared to pay for their business - with 93% strongly agreeing with the statement \"it is paramount that the firm I sell to has a good reputation compared to just 47 per cent who strongly agree with the statement that it is paramount that I am paid a good price\".\n\nFinli said that it is \"never just about the money\" and that there are emotional considerations that need to be given due thought when taking on another financial planner's clients.\n\nThe recently rebranded national said that the narrative around acquiring books of business is \"all too often exclusively focused on the onboarding mechanics and the numbers â the size of each tranche that is to be seeded across each month\".\n\nThe firm asked financial planners what their aspirations were for themselves and their clients when they come to retire.\n\nSome 78% strongly agreed that it is paramount to know that they made a difference in their clients' lives,15% strongly agreed that it is paramount that they can retain a non-advisory relationship with their clients (with a further 32% somewhat agreeing), 95% strongly agree that they want their clients to know the firm they've chosen to take over from them is their parting good 'advice', and 100% strongly agree that they want their clients to feel listened to, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, 80% strongly agree (and 18% somewhat agree) that it is important that the firm that takes over is culturally aligned with their values and those of their clients.\n\n\"Of course, financial planners want to get a good price for their business. And so they should. However, these are businesses that have been built on nurturing relationships, some spanning several decades. So, it should come as no surprise that financial planners place so much importance on the acquiring firm having a good reputation for looking after clients â even that it Top Trumps the sale price,\" said Finli group chief distribution officer Simon Goldthorpe.\n\nGoldthorpe added: \"Of course, they can have both when it's the right fit! However, understanding and, importantly, appreciating that any deal is as much about emotions as it is about the headline figure and the mechanics of the sale is in everyone's best interests. These findings act as a timely reminder of the need to place equal weighting on both.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "The adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.\n\nThe adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.",
         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: âThe increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

Last month (24 January), it unveiled its M&A support service for the wealth management sector, said to \"reduce transaction timelines by an average of six weeks\".\n\nFor those looking to acquire businesses, Flower suggested considering \"good client data\". \"Acquirers like to hear that a business cares about its clients, such as when someone remembers the small things about their clients, rather than viewing their clients as numbers,\" he noted. \"Listening skills are very important in this space.\"\n\nHe added: \"When you're looking to acquire a business, you need to think to yourself, âCan I see this business fit in with us?'\"\n\nFlower noted that many business owners fear losing value during acquisitions. \"They ask themselves, âIs this going to reduce my value?'\" he said.\n\nTo alleviate such concerns, The Flower Group helps prepare sellers for the demands of due diligence and supports acquirers with key insights into the cultural and operational dynamics of their targets.\n\nEnsuring cultural fit and human capital stability\n\nHoxton Wealth founder and CEO Chris Ball highlighted the importance of understanding whether the human capital within the business will remain post-acquisition.\n\n\"Are you buying someone's book that's retiring? If so, then it's important that if they're saying they're retiring, they actually retire,\" Ball explained. \"If they don't have a real reason for retiring, they may find it too difficult and emotional to leave and could return, which creates challenges.\"\n\nHe also stressed the importance of evaluating existing employees before completing the acquisition.\n\n\"If you're keeping the human capital, it's important to meet those people before you buy the business. You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their âbaby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this â often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to Â£3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locationsâsuch as whether employees will work remotely or in an officeâneed to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open â being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation â leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach â communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration â it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being âdone to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer â ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "Tallying losses on AIB stake after bank buys back my shares",
         "I received the proceeds of 13 AIB shares, having opted to sell these under the scheme announced by the bank for small shareholders some time back. The shares represent a huge dilution of the original shares which were acquired over many years between the early 1990s and roughly 2007.\n\nWould you know how I would go about calculating the capital loss on these shares in case I need to offset gains somewhere else? Some of the shares may have been acquired by way of scrip dividends, which adds to the complexity.",
         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those â¬13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of â¬73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank. The â¬5.65 a share offer â a 5 per cent premium to the market price â was simply the final insult in an investment that has proven catastrophic over the past 14 years.\n\nThose 250 shares that would have been worth â¬17.50 just before the consolidation announcement, and â¬8.75 on the last day the old shares traded on December 18th, became a single share which was worth â¬8.50 at the close of trading on December 21st. However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of â¬6,000 â â¬5,987.50 to be precise â at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way. At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of â¬78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares â shares given in lieu of cash dividends â the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the â¬18.98 a share the bankâs stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the â¬5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. Thatâs 2.26 cent. So your loss on that dayâs trade is almost â¬18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records â or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares â for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, youâll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYouâre talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain â because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price â for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

         "*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaicaâs general insurance sector.",
         "Earl Jarrett, CEO of the Jamaica National Group (JN Group), made the disclosure to staff earlier this week.\n\nâThe JN Financial Group will sign an agreement today for British Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) to purchase its shares in JN General Insurance (JNGI),â Jarrett wrote in a note circulated to staff on Monday. The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms. But those negotiations are continuing,â Levy added.\n\nJNGI will continue to renew motor and property insurance through its branches and brokers as well as honour insurance claims until the sale is finalised.\n\nâOnce the sale is finalised, the JNGI portfolio, business, and locations will be fully managed by BCIC. All positions within JNGI will be made redundant; however, some JNGI employees will be invited to explore opportunities within BCIC,â Jarrettâs e-mail said.\n\nIt noted that JNGI employees and the National Workersâ Union, the bargaining entity that represents the workers, have been kept informed of the planned sale, adding that dialogue is ongoing regarding the future of the employees.\n\nLevy said he didnât know how many of the JNGI staff will be given positions at BCIC.\n\nâWell, a lot of the work weâll be doing once we sign the deal will be around filling out those details. So, at the current time, we donât really know,â Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\nâThe analysis that weâve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,â Levy said. âInsurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I donât think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.â\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCICâs position as one of the leading players in Jamaicaâs general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "The National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) has accepted one of Banc Sabadell's demands and will open the market test it is finalizing regarding BBVA's takeover bid for the Catalan bank to both business associations and trade unions, according to industry sources.\n\nThis was one of the requests of Sabadell's chairman, Josep Oliu, who has even compared the lack of participation of these agents in the market test to \"asking the fox if he wants the hens to run free\".",
         "During the in-depth analysis of the operation, known as phase two, the CNMC rejected the allegations of 79 associations and only accepted that of Sabadell, considering that it is the only one with a legitimate interest. Two of the organizations that submitted allegations, Foment del Treball and UGT, have filed appeals before the National Court, both of which have been admitted for processing.\n\nThe market test has not yet been launched, but some associations have already been informed that they will be taken into account. By opening the procedure, they will at least have the opportunity to express their opinion during this process on an operation which, they say, limits competition, especially in the SME business, and puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStructural conditions of conductThe market test is being launched after the agreement of commitments between BBVA and the CNMC, in which the behavioral guidelines set out by the opting bank are maintained, mainly related to measures such as maintaining branches except those that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters and commercial conditions for customers for a certain period.\n\nThe CNMC accepts BBVA's approach, although tightening the time commitments, which in some aspects go up to three years. This is a different approach to that advocated by Sabadell, which calls for structural measures and asks that the market test itself should ask the sector whether BBVA should sell assets in order to maintain competition.\n\nOnce the test has been launched, the sector's agents will have ten working days to reply, after which the CNMC's Competition Directorate will submit the final report to the plenary for approval of the opinion.\n\nIt is at that moment when the Ministry of Economy will have 15 days to decide whether to analyze the file and, within 30 additional days, submit it to the Council of Ministers, which may establish additional conditions to BBVA.\n\nBBVA is confident that it will be able to launch the takeover bid in June, although the next few days will be key to determine the speed of the process and whether, given the holiday break, the operation will be postponed until after August.",

         "ING's role (past, present and future) in BBVA's takeover bid for Sabadell",
         "ING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.\n\nThe entity has been very explicit in recognizing that it wants to grow in markets such as Spain, much more than what banks usually do before carrying out relevant operations. \"We want to grow in larger markets, such as Italy, Spain and Germany,\" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in early February. \"M&A is an option everywhere, if it fits our criteria,\" he added.",
         "Spain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio JuliÃ¡, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena RomÃ¡n as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena RomÃ¡n returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put RomÃ¡n in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique PiÃ±el as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

         "For family offices, high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) considering the purchase of luxury assets (in particular yachts, artworks and aircraft) there are multiple factors to consider, not least deciding on the optimum structure to purchase and hold such luxury assets.\n\nWhen purchasing a luxury asset, one of the first considerations should be the structure through which such luxury asset will be purchased and subsequently held. One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",
         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured âoff balance sheetâ and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from âlimited liability recourseâ meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise, currently not available to the general public.\n\nTax Neutrality: The BVI is tax neutral meaning that there is no income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax levied in the BVI. In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "Torres (BBVA) expects the CNMC to authorize the takeover bid for Sabadell in the \"coming weeks\" and conclude before the summer.",
         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper InformaciÃ³n in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",
         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide. The shareholder is king, just as everyone is king with their own property. When you want to sell your house, it is up to you to decide whether to sell it or not. Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del MediterrÃ¡neo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "BBVA defends the takeover bid for Sabadell: \"We do not expect the Government to impose a veto on the operation\".",
         "The Chairman and CEO of BBVA, Carlos Torres, expressed his satisfaction with BBVA's record annual profits, above 10,000 million euros, thanks to the improvement in all markets and business areas. This was another reason for him to defend the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, about which he commented that \"Europe needs larger banks to be able to make the necessary investments to maintain a sustainable position for the future. This operation gives us the opportunity to have more than 5,000 million in financing, which means paying more taxes, a greater global reach based on meritocracy and the creation of value for shareholders that the operation entails. Together we can achieve greater goals that would be impossible to achieve separately.",
         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at TelefÃ³nica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Ãlvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in TelefÃ³nica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the â¬0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of â¬0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate â¬5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents â¬0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa GÃ³mez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, GÃ³mez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

         "Smaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.\n\nSmaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.",
         "Jeffreys told FT Adviser she expected more changes to happen within the M&A market in the coming 12 months - and it would be the acquirers and consolidators themselves who might consolidate.\n\nShe said: âMany PE-backed acquirers took investment in 2019, so the PE houses will be on a countdown to exit their positions, and a wave of transactions is likely.\n\nâThe number of new entrant buyers at that point in time (approximately 15 firms) left many buyers competing over the same targets. As a result, most have not achieved the scale expected by their backers at this stage.\n\nâMergers will give the PE houses the opportunity to exit their positions with more scale and see a new set of investors into the market.â\n\n'We will walk away from a deal': how consolidators have become 'picky'\n\nJeffreys believed there would be three key themes that would dominate the M&A landscape in 2025, with the first being the number of firms coming to market.\n\nâThe buyer market is extensive â it is broad and deep and made up of a mix of firms seeking different outcomes from acquisitive growth.\n\nâThe market can absolutely support an uptick in firms for sale. However, there will be increased competition over the highest quality, and the risk that other firms fail to attract significant interest.\n\nâFurthermore, there is a risk a bottle-neck could occur in the FCAâs change in the team approving company sales. During Covid, we saw significant delays to deals due to the CIC taking significantly longer than anticipated, and if this happens again it may mean sellers looking to beat tax hike deadlines will not succeed.\n\nâIt could also lead to poor behaviour reported pre-budget, where it was rumoured some sales were going through without the necessary regulatory approvals,â she explained.\n\nJeffreys also predicted buyers would be putting significant focus on the integration of the firms they buy.\n\nIf supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted. Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the âbuy & buildâ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\nâThe consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\nâMany of the âbuy & buildâ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\nâThat further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.â\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labourâs first Budget for 14 years has had a âhuge impactâ on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\nâBADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\nâIt could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\nâFurthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale â potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,â she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

         "The acquisition of firms is a common practice in the consulting sector, with recent examples among the Big Four and large technology companies, such as EY with the purchase of Attalea Partners, Deloitte acquiring Keytree or Accenture integrating Axis Corporate. Although this approach is not usually the main driver of growth for these companies, there are already international firms such as McKinsey that are showing more and more interest in this type of strategy. In this scenario, Jungle, despite being significantly smaller than these large consulting firms, is positioned as one of the few firms that bases its growth strategy on a programmatic M&A, with the goal of acquiring up to four firms a year.",
         "This Spanish company, which is listed on the French market, but is considering listing in Spain next year, recently closed its fourth annual purchase, with the acquisition of Move Branding, which joins the other three consulting firms acquired this year: the technology firm MilÃº, the creative agency BUM and Liquid Lab, a technology consulting firm owned by the former CEO of Mobile World Capital Barcelona.\n\nBoth in this last acquisition and in the other 10 that Jungle intends to make from 2025 onwards, it is relying on the advice of Grant Thornton and the GÃ³mez Acebo law firm. In addition, for these future acquisitions, the consulting firm will allocate 40 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the company, led by AgustÃ­n Vivancos, has its own M&A department led by a creative person with a financial profile. This team analyzes a portfolio of almost 300 companies per year, of which they contact about 100 and end up negotiating with three dozen of them. Some of these acquired companies end up becoming spin-offs, as is the case of True, Meme or Libero Creative Club, specialized in soccer.\n\nSince 2022, the consulting firm has already added a dozen new acquisitions. With the constant growth in size, Jungle faces the challenge of acquiring larger and larger companies, which implies more significant investments.\n\nThe company expects to close 2024 with a turnover of $40 million To ensure the profitability of these operations, the firm uses a growth and integration methodology based on three fundamental pillars: 1,000-day strategic planning, weekly accountability and management focused on a maximum of three KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, Jungle recordedtotal revenues of â¬27.2 million, a 49% growth compared to the previous year. The consultancy projects to close 2024 with revenues of â¬40 million and an estimated EBITDA of â¬7 million.

Solvency position, broad product portfolio and investment income status are the key strengths of the company, even as its premium earnings remain causes for concern. A short-term economic outlook of Bahrain, a positive outlook for the non-life insurance segment in Bahrain and UAE, could provide ample growth opportunities for the company. However, risks related to online identity theft and hacking, fluctuations in interest rates, and intense competition could affect the companyâs business performance.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nSolvency\n\nInvestment Income\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nARIGâs broad product portfolio enables it to enhance its scalability to cater to the distinctive requirements of its clientele. The company offers a range of non-life and life reinsurance products and services across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Its portfolio of reinsurance products includes treaty reinsurance, life reinsurance, medical reinsurance, and property reinsurance. It also offers facultative reinsurance for specialty lines, such as casualty, engineering, marine hull, cargo, marine liabilities, and motor extended warranty. ARIGâs services include risk management, account handling, and claims payment services.\n\nSolvency\n\nSound solvency of the company strengthens its ability to borrow and repay the money, which in turn enhances its business operations. According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The companyâs insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloydâs portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrainâs GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the companyâs profitability. The companyâs investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the companyâs control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the companyâs operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the companyâs operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the companyâs portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Companyâs 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: á´ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. á´ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. á´ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company â¢ While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor âGulf Tamin Ltdâ was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. â¢ The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. â¢ As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Companyâs Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. â¢ The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholdersâ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the companyâs paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the companyâs shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIGâS REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIGâS INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, companyâs funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Directors further extend their thanks to our business partners, clients, staff and shareholders for their support and cooperation throughout the year.\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\n2 Shenton Way\n\n#13-02, SGX Centre 1\n\nSingapore City\n\nSGP\n\n65 65366618\n\n65 65366619\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nBrighton Place\n\nGround Floor, Shoplot No. U0215\n\nJalan Bahasa\n\nLabuan\n\nLabuan (Federal Territory of)\n\nMYS\n\n60 87 442899\n\n60 87 451899\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nUnit 12C, 12th Floor Raffles Tower\n\n19 Cybercity\n\nEbene\n\nMUS\n\n230 466 0112\n\n230 466 0114\n\nArig Capital Limited\n\n4th Floor\n\nMitre House\n\n12 14 Mitre Street\n\nGBR\n\n44 20 3207 0081\n\nGulf Warranties W.L.L\n\nPO Box 5209\n\nDubai\n\nBHR\n\n973 4 3355347\n\n973 4 3355679\n\nwww.gulfwarranties.com\n\nTakaful Re Limited\n\nDIFC, Dubai International Financial Centre\n\nThe gate district, Precinct building 3, level 4, Tenancy 3\n\nP.O.

         "* Barnes & Noble plans to open around 60 new stores in the US, says CEO James Daunt.\n\n* Daunt said it would be \"logical\" to consider a future initial public offering in London or New York.",
         "* Barnes & Noble was acquired by Elliott Investment Management for $683 million in 2019.\n\nJames Daunt, the CEO of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, said he would open about 60 new stores in the US.\n\nThe British bookseller boss told the Financial Times that he is considering a future initial public offering in London or New York as well as the expansion.\n\nThroughout 2024, 57 Barnes & Noble locations were opened across the US, which currently has approximately 600 stores. In the UK, 12 new stores were added. Speaking about additions in the new year, Daunt said to the FT that he plans to \"do that or more in 2025.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest book chain in America. After he quit his investment banking job, Daunt launched Daunt Books in London in 1990 â where there are now about 10 stores. In 2011, he was appointed managing director of British bookseller Waterstones to help the struggling business, which faced growing competition from Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Waterstones was sold to Elliott Investment Management by Russian billionaire and publisher Alexander Mamut. Barnes & Noble was acquired by the same New York-headquartered hedge fund the following year for $683 million.\n\nDaunt was named CEO of both book retailers. He also continues to run his independent book chain in London.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble and Waterstones boss told the FT it would be \"logical\" to contemplate an IPO but that any plan would be based on Elliott's strategy for the future. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the FT reported there are no current plans to list the chains. However, it could be a possibility at a later stage.\n\nAt present, Daunt hopes to combine the IT and finance platforms at Barnes & Noble and Waterstones into one system.\n\nHe noted that it was a \"solid Christmas\" because as the holiday fell on a Wednesday, last-minute shoppers had the weekend before to purchase gifts.\n\n\"The last weekend and [December] 23-24 were exceptional on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he told the FT. \"It has been a good post-Christmas as well.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

         "5 Red Flags to Watch Out for in Small Business Acquisitions",
         "Recognize the warning signs to help avoid costly mistakes in your next merger or acquisition.\n\nNatalia Tkachenko-Horbachevska, an Entrepreneursâ Organization (EO) member in Ukraine, is the founder and CEO of Task Force language services, which CSA Research 2024 ranked in the TOP 5 fastest-growing language services companies globally. From her offices in Poland and Ukraine, Tkachenko-Horbachevska shared her U.S. growth strategy journey, which includes a lesson on mergers and acquisitions.",
         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. Youâre ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.âbut canât quite find the time because thereâs already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And thenâwar breaks out in your country.\n\nThatâs what happened to my company. I work in the field of language servicesâtranslations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldnât be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work. Peopleâs immediate concerns were fuel (to flee), food, and medicine.\n\nThe strategy of âclaiming more local market shareâ seemed irrelevantâI thought there would be no market left to claim. Thankfully, I was wrong, and we continue to work actively in Ukraine. I was in despair for the first two days of the war but then decided that despair is not productive, so I put all my energy into work.\n\nThus, in early 2022, we made a 180-degree shift. We chose Poland as our new home market. It was the only growing economy in Europe, close to Ukraine, and provided an inroad to the European market. From there, we could both help our fellow Ukrainian businesspeople and expand internationally. Poland would become our launchpad for selling services worldwide.\n\nWe needed to âlocalizeâ ourselves in Europe. Ukraine is its own world, and Europeâthe EU in particularâis another, with its own rules we had yet to learn. Our goal was to âbecome part ofâ Europe.\n\nThe fastest, most logical solution was to acquire a company. We explored potential targets in Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didnât have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, âIt doesnât matter when the client buysânow or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,â it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a companyâs sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, âIt seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I donât really track that.â The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performedâall data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the companyâs direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, itâs critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didnât have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Ownerâs resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasnât appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we havenât lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europeâyet.\n\nClick to view image.",

In a short statement, Retelit said the assets included in the transaction generated revenues of around EUR 160 million in 2024, without disclosing the financial terms agreed upon.\n\nThe B2B specialist did specify that the acquisition would serve to enhance its proprietary fibre-optic network by an additional 11,500 km to over 47,000 km, while adding a further 10 MW of power capacity to its national data centre infrastructure. It would also boost its suite of ICT infrastructure and services to support the innovation and the digital transformation of Italian businesses.",

The deal completed on December 31 and was announced to the stock market yesterday morning.\n\nWood suffered a series of setbacks in 2024. In February it confirmed it was looking to cut 22 âcorporate functionâ jobs in Aberdeen.\n\nThen, in August, the group saw a collapse in its share price as Sidara walked away from a proposed takeover deal.\n\nWood shares fell from almost Â£2 a share to just Â£1.21, wiping around Â£450m off the value of the company. But more bad news was to come. Later in August, Wood announced its half-year results, which showed a decline in turnover and a Â£756m loss.\n\nThe losses were mainly due to exceptional charges of Â£743m, including a Â£626m impairment charge and a Â£107m loss to exit contracts.\n\nNovemberâs trading update contained another warning which spooked investors and saw Wood shares lose more than half their value.\n\nIt said it had instructed an independent review of its books be carried out. Deloitte will look at âreported positions on contracts in projects, accounting, governance and controls, including whether any prior year restatement may be required.â\n\nWood shares closed below 50p for the first time in the companyâs history. Since November, there has been a small recovery. With news of the completion of the Ethos Energy deal, shares were up around 3% yesterday at 67p.\n\nEthos Energy contributed Â£27m of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to Woodâs results in 2023. The deal with One Equity Partners includes Â£33.6m of previously planned loan notes replaced by an additional cash consideration.\n\nKen Gilmartin, chief executive of Wood, said: âWe are pleased to complete the sale of Ethos Energy to One Equity Partners.\n\nâThis strategic divestment is part of our strategy to be selective and focused on our core business. We will continue to align our portfolio as part of our commitment to simplify Wood.â",

         "France's InVivo seeks Ukraine silos for postwar grain trading push",
         "PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - French agriculture firm InVivo is looking to acquire silos at Ukraine's Odesa port to bolster its global trading business and refocus on its cereal activities, its chief executive told Reuters.\n\nDespite massive destruction since Russia's invasion, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest grain exporters via its Black Sea ports in the Odesa region.",
         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processing,\" Blandinieres said.\n\nThat includes Soufflet Malt, one of the world's biggest producers of the barley-based beer and whisky ingredient.\n\nThe unit on Friday announced a 100 million euro investment to build a malt factory in South Africa with Heineken.\n\n($1 = 0.9161 euros) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Sybille de La Hamaide) ",

         "Spain is planning to introduce a 100% tax on the value of properties purchased by people who are not from the European Union (EU).\n\nSpanish prime minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the move would help address the country's housing shortage, the BBC reported.",
         "He said non-EU residents bought 27,000 Spanish properties in 2023 with many destined for the rental market.\n\nPre-election soundbite?\n\nSeila Sanches Lucas is a UK and Spanish-qualified lawyer at the international law firm Broadfield who helps clients buy and sell property in Spain.\n\nShe said: \"The proposal by the Spanish prime minister will be concerning for those that have already chosen to retire in Spain and for those considering a retirement in the sun.\n\n\"It is just a proposal at this point in time and is not guaranteed to make it onto the Spanish statute books.\n\n\"It would be interesting to know whether this proposal would extend to the entire country or to particularly regions. UK nationals who have already retired and living in Spain will also want to know whether this tax could be levied retrospectively.\"\n\nShe added: \"It should be noted that some consider the Spanish prime minister is politically vulnerable and this may simply be a pre-election soundbite to boost his popularity. Even if adopted, the legislative process in Spain is tortiously slow and it is perhaps a little early for UK nationals to worry about this proposal.\n\n\"If adopted, there are many other jurisdictions looking to attract wealthy retirees and investors. For example, Dubai has been called the âNew Marbella'.\"\n\nSpain has already set a date to close its so-called \"golden\" investor visa set up from 3 April this year. The visa previously gave foreign investors fast-tracked residency but will now be scrapped.\n\nFragomen is an immigration specialist law firm. Director Isobel Neilson said closing of the investor visa will be a \"huge blow for retirees from the UK looking to move to Spain\".\n\n\"They will now have to look to other passive routes to obtain residency such as the non-lucrative visa â this is unfortunately less flexible, does not allow the applicant to work (even remotely) in Spain and requires full-time residency (six months a year) to maintain the status.\n\n\"One of the requirements of this visa is that the applicant needs to evidence accommodation in Spain. This can either be through a lease or showing title deeds to a property in Spain.\n\n\"If the proposed 100% tax on homeownership for non-EU nationals were to be introduced our clients would most likely look to rent instead of buying or alternatively explore other more favourable EU jurisdictions offering similar status such as the D7 visa in Portugal or the elective residency permit in Italy.\"\n\nRead more: Retiring abroad: Helping clients get their place in the sun\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",
         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Gold currently trades 1.8% lower at $2,604.50 a troy ounce, with investors now waiting for U.S. PCE inflation data due on Friday. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n\n1104 ET - Brazilian assets are undervalued, \"but it will be challenging to reverse this negative trend,\" Santader economists write. The country faces a worsening fiscal situation, rising inflation and steep borrowing costs. The currency has lost 27% of its dollar value this year and the Ibovespa stock index is down nearly 10%. \"Local institutional clients are preparing for potential outflows by building up cash reserves, and foreign investors are also hesitant,\" Santander says. The economists expect persistently elevated risk premiums in the country. They say, however, that Brazil has a variety of competitive companies \"that are benefiting from secular trends.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1046 ET - The more cautious approach to interest-rate cuts signaled by the Bank of England feels risky, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

         "Deal In Brief",
         "Constantinsborg A/S (Offeror) has decided to make an all-cash voluntary public tender offer all shares in FirstFarms A/S (FirstFarms) (other than own shares held by FirstFarms and shares already held by the Offeror) (the Offer) for a cash price of DKK 84 per share of nominally DKK 10 (the Offer Price). The Offeror is indirectly owned and controlled by Heartland A/S (Heartland) The Offeror will offer DKK 84 for each share of nominally DKK 10, subject to adjustment for any dividends or other distributions declared or paid to the shareholders of FirstFarms prior to completion of the Offer. The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025. The Offer values FirstFarms' entire share capital at approx. DKK 936 million. Further, the Offer Price corresponds at least to the price at which the Offeror is entitled to convert its existing convertible loan and which was determined and negotiated between the Offeror and FirstFarms in connection with the issuance of the loan on 29 February 2024. Completion of the Offer will be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, but completion will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarmsâ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. According to the terms and conditions of the offer document, the Offeror will be entitled to extend the offer period. Following publication of the offer document, all shareholders in FirstFarms (except shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions) will be able to sell their FirstFarms shares to the Offeror during the offer period. FirstFarmsâ board of directors is required to prepare a statement explaining the board's view on the Offer and the reasons forsuch view. The statement must be published before expiry of the first half of the offer period. Because of her relations toConstantinsborg A/S, Lise Kaae will not participate in the preparation of the statement by the board of directors. The Offeror will announce the final results of the Offer no later than three business days after expiry of the offer period (which may be extended) and expects completion of the Offer in Q2 2025. The Offeror has appointed Kromann Reumert as its legal adviser in connection with the Offer.\n\nDeal Type     Acquisition\nSub-Category  100% Acquisition\nDeal Status   Rumour: 2025-02-11\n\n\nDeal Participants\n\nTarget (Company)    FirstFarms A/S\nAcquirer (Company)  Constantinsborg A/S\n\n\nDeal Rationale\n\n% Acquisition  100%\n\n\n(c) 2001-2016 Marketline.

         "*Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable",
         "14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable\n\nThe following is a press release from Fitch Ratings:",
         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

         "* Travel group collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal\n\nEY has been fined Â£4.9million by the Financial Reporting Council for its audits of Thomas Cook in 2017 and 2018.",
         "Thomas Cook collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal, but now operates in the UK as an online-only travel agent.\n\nThe fine was originally Â£6.5million, but was discounted by 25 per cent 'for admissions and early disposal.' EY paid also paid the costs for the investigation.\n\nEY audit engagement partner Richard Wilson was fined Â£140,000, discounted to Â£105,000 for the same reason.\n\nThe FRC imposed sanctions on EY and Wilson over audits for the airline for the financial years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog said the airlineâs goodwill balance was significant, comprising Â£2.6billion across the whole group, roughly 40 per cent of total assets.\n\nThe breaches related to assessing Thomas Cook's goodwill impairment level and going concern status, as well as adequately considering the risk to EY's independence during the 2018 audit, the FRC said.\n\nFollowing an investigation, it was found that for both audit years, EY and Wilson failed to 'approach this audit area with sufficient professional scepticism to properly corroborate managementâs assumptions and estimates supporting the goodwill impairment model'.\n\nThe FRC said 'the failings' for this 'were particularly serious' for 2018 'given Thomas Cookâs deteriorating trading performance, which heightened the risk that the goodwill balance could be impaired.'\n\nClaudia Mortimore, FRC deputy executive counsel, said: 'EY and Mr Wilsonâs failure to challenge robustly and to apply sufficient professional scepticism in these crucial areas led to significant breaches of auditing standards in both audit years.\n\n'The failings in 2018 are particularly serious given Thomas Cookâs financial position and the heightened risks surrounding the audit work.\n\n'EYâs remedial measures together with the programme of non-financial sanctions are designed to prevent such failures being repeated.'\n\nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed in 2019 after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding more than 100,000 passengers overseas and leaving many without jobs.\n\nChinese company Fosun later acquired the company's brand, before selling it to Polish travel platform eSky Group last year.",

         "In early 2025, Igor Mazepa's Concorde Capital bought the oil and gas service company Beiken Energy Ukraine, the Ukrainian subsidiary of the Chinese Beiken, for more than $25 million, Forbes reports.\n\nMazepa plans to provide drilling services both in Ukraine and abroad. The acquired company has 8 drilling rigs and plans to receive $10 million EBITDA for 2025. The lifting capacity of the acquired drilling rigs is from 125 to 450 tons.",
         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "Everton face Bournemouth on Saturday but there is obvious focus on the business they may or may not be able to do in the January transfer window now they have new owners\n\nSean Dyche believes this is the first transfer window heâs had at Everton where he doesnât have to sell to balance the books.",
         "The Toffees boss insists any sales this month will be only if theyâre bringing in a better player. The club was finally taken over by the Friedkin Group last month when the American firm got Premier League approval.\n\nIt follows years of penny pinching when Farhad Moshiriâs wild spending dried up and left the Toffees stuck with financial problems which led to points deductions last season.\n\nThe club has sold star assets like Anthony Gordon, Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana since Dyche arrived two years ago. But now, ahead of todayâs clash at Bournemouth, he insists the only sales happening will be if it is to make room for better players as the new owners bring stability.\n\nâApart from the PSR thing, the stability is there so that has changed,â said Dyche. âThereâs not that need but you still have to work the right market. These guys [TFG] are certainly not wanting to weaken us. Itâs the rules, not the intent.\n\nâWhat youâre saying is kind of right but it [sales] has to make us stronger. We are not under any pressure to get weaker by selling players but what can you do to make us stronger\n\nâThat is the good side of having the stability the owners talked about. We donât need to do anything, that has changed. It is about decision-making. Within the guidelines of the PSR. If we can sell one and bring someone in, that is something we would have to look at.â\n\nRelegation battling Everton, who go to Bournemouth looking for their first win at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League, have yet to have any interest in their current squad this month.\n\nMisfiring forward Beto is one player who may be on the way out if the right offer comes along though as he has struggled to deliver while on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja is now fit to compete with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nâLetâs see what the market offers,â said Dyche. âWe have had no phone-calls, we are making lots of them to see what we can do, see what is around and what can open.\n\nâAt the end of the day, our situation here is that we certainly will not be letting anyone go unless we are needed to. Unless of course we can swap and change. We want to keep the squad, we have had injuries and been very stretched. We are certainly not looking to have players going out.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community \n\nand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Demand from investors covered all the shares offered by Hotelbeds owner HBX Group in its initial public offering within hours, the bookrunner said on Friday, ahead of what is set to be the largest listing in Europe so far this year.\n\nThe Spanish travel technology company said on Thursday it intended to raise 725 million euros ($752.6 million) by selling new shares that would start trading on the Spanish stock market on Feb. 13.",
         "The demand also covered the so-called 'greenshoe option', an additional number of shares potentially offered to investors if demand is strong enough, the bookrunner said on Friday.\n\nThe company has set a price range for its shares between 10.50 euros and 12.50 euros, which would give the whole company a market value of between 2.66 billion euros and 3.03 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations based on the IPO prospectus.\n\nThe private equity-owned company has been planning an IPO for more than a year, Reuters has reported previously, and has recently been sounding out investors.\n\nHBX's shareholders include private equity firms Cinven and EQT, and Canada's CPP Investments. Existing shareholders intend to sell existing shares worth about 25 million euros combined, the company has said.\n\nHBX Group would be the first to launch a European IPO this year after a slight recovery in issuance last year.\n\nThat saw cosmetics and fashion group Puig and private equity fund CVC raising more than 2 billion euros respectively in Madrid and Amsterdam, but Europastry cancelling its market debut due to market instability.\n\n($1 = 0.9633 euros) (Reporting by Inti Landauro, Jesus Aguado and Tomas Cobos, editing by Aislinn Laing and Jan Harvey) ",

         "Investment platform says it is âhighly competitive in the roundâ\n\nAJ Bell insisted its pricing represented good value for money for its clients after it again lifted the amount it takes in interest on their cash balances.",
         "The investment platforms operator reported a 29 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record Â£113.3 million and set out plans for a Â£30 million share buyback.\n\nRevenues grew by 23 per cent to Â£269.4 million on the back of winning a net 66,000 new customers, taking its customer base to 557,000.\n\nThe company said that the net interest it earned from customer balances increased in the year to September, but declined to quantify it, saying that the run rate peaked in March.\n\nMichael Summersgill, chief executive, said the firm was highly competitive looking at âpricing in the roundâ. Interest it pays to customers on their balances ranges from 1.8 per cent for cash in a dealing account up to as much as 4.27 per cent for cash held in some pension accounts.\n\nâWeâre an investment platform. People donât come to us to hold cash,â he said. âWe give great value to our customers.â\n\nInvestment platforms have come under pressure to improve their pricing with the Financial Conduct Authority writing to all of them reminding them of their responsibilities under\n\nthe new consumer duty \n\n.\n\nFor years, platforms made no money on customer balances, with base rate close to zero. But rises in base rate to a high of 5.25 per cent throughout the year to July has delivered them lucrative windfalls. Base rate has since come down to 4.75 per cent.\n\nFavourable market movements during the year added Â£9.5 billion to total assets under management, while net customer inflows of Â£6.1 billion, a rise from Â£4.2 billion last time, pushed the total figure to Â£86.5 million.\n\nSummersgill said successful advertising had helped the group, pushing spontaneous awareness of the brand above 50 per cent from 30 per cent two years ago.\n\nAJ Bell is a Top 3 investment platform business, serving DIY investors directly through its direct-to-customer unit and serving another tranche indirectly through a platform for financial advisers. It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14Â½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. âOver the long term I wouldnât say weâll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.â\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than Â£800,000 a year ago to Â£6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: âThe long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.â\n\nPensions tax âis unworkableâ\n\nThe governmentâs plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bellâs chief executive has said.\n\nâIt is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,â Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: âIf the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,â he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased personâs estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise Â£640 million in 2027-28, Â£1.34 billion in 2028-29 and Â£1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: âMost estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first Â£325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to Â£500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and Â£1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\nâWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.â",

         "PAXMAN has carried out a directed issue of 1.9 million new shares, raising proceeds of SEK 123.5 million",
         "Stockholm: Paxman AB has issued the following news release:\n\nThe Board of Directors of Paxman AB (publ) (\"PAXMAN\" or the \"Company\") has, based on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024 and in accordance with the Company's press release earlier today, resolved on a directed issue of 1,900,000 new shares (the \"Share Issue\"). Through the Share Issue, PAXMAN will receive SEK 123.5 million before issue costs. The subscription price in the Share Issue has been set to SEK 65.0 per share through an accelerated bookbuilding procedure (the \"Bookbuilding\") conducted by Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ). The Share Issue was subscribed by several Swedish and international institutional investors, including Eiffel Investment Group and Unionen, as well as certain existing shareholders, including Alcur Fonder, Andra AP-Fonden, Aktia Asset Management and SEB Asset Management.",
         "As announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue.

         "Impending fintech consolidation could yield unprecedented exit values, says Artis Partners; Acquisitions have already become the norm in the payments space, with the wider sector now set to follow suit",
         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 â an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Eliteâs acquisition of Tranch and Neonomicsâ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",
         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: âAn M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. Weâre already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\nâThe key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers â sometimes direct rivals â in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\nâMany of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\nâAs a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months. If founders arenât considering a strategic exit, they could miss out on a prime opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market, and risk losing ground to rivals who stand to benefit from a larger pool of resources through acquisition.â\n\nBasta concluded: âPursuing the funding route will only dilute ownership stakes and reduce overall profitability when the time eventually comes to sell; even more so today since the fundraising market has not come back nearly as strongly as M&A. Itâs time for fintechs to begin the exit planning phase to ensure they remain competitive and take advantage of the industryâs significant momentum.â\n\n-ENDS-\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout Artis Partners\n\nArtis Partners is a boutique investment bank specialising in strategic M&A and fundraising, delivering high exit values for growth stage European and US technology companies.

         "UK's private share trading plan will be a flop, says buyout veteran Jon Moulton; Pisces has come under criticism in recent weeks",
         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "Nearly two years after the outbreak of the so-called Factop case, the brothers Ariel and Daniel Sauer continue to be the focus of new legal actions by those who claim to be victims of the scheme of false invoices and irregular financing unleashed within the factoring company.\n\nThis Monday, the foreign investment fund \"EMF Microfinance Fund AGmvK\" of the Swiss fund manager Enabling Qapital filed a lawsuit against the brothers and main shareholders of Factop, for the crimes of fraud and forgery, as well as malicious use of a private commercial instrument.",
         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million. To which are added what would have been accrued for the interest rate of 15.6% of the capital owed, \"payable in six installments, of which only one was paid\".",

         "National financial planner The Finli Group has completed its acquisition of Schaefer Financial Management.\n\nIn February this year, Finli - formerly Solomon Capital Holdings - agreed a deal to acquire Schaefer Financial Management in Somerset. The acquisition of MMR Financial Planning which took place in March in Birmingham brings the firm's total acquisitions to 41.",
         "This is its second completed acquisition in two months. Finli said it is on target to complete further deals this month across Kent, Cardiff, Merseyside and Somerset, feeding directly into three of its core regions.\n\nThe firm, which has four regions in total and offices across England, Scotland and Wales, is looking to grow its local presence in Scotland, the north of England, central England and southern regions.\n\nIn January last year, Finli snapped up Scottish IFA Clark Gillone following its previous purchases of Beaufort Group and Gale and Phillipson.\n\nIt aims to add Â£1bn in assets annually and said it is open to speaking to adviser firms of all sizes from Â£25m under advice.\n\nFinli acquisitions director Jon Barham said: \"Acquiring firms often talk about the ideal size of a firm looking to sell.\n\n\"For us, it's about the ideal attitude. If you want to do right by your clients, then we want to talk to you!\"\n\nFinancial planners rank the reputation of acquiring firm above what they'll pay\n\nA recent poll conducted by Finli showed financial planners give greater consideration to the reputation of potential acquirers than they do the sum they are prepared to pay for their business - with 93% strongly agreeing with the statement \"it is paramount that the firm I sell to has a good reputation compared to just 47 per cent who strongly agree with the statement that it is paramount that I am paid a good price\".\n\nFinli said that it is \"never just about the money\" and that there are emotional considerations that need to be given due thought when taking on another financial planner's clients.\n\nThe recently rebranded national said that the narrative around acquiring books of business is \"all too often exclusively focused on the onboarding mechanics and the numbers â the size of each tranche that is to be seeded across each month\".\n\nThe firm asked financial planners what their aspirations were for themselves and their clients when they come to retire.\n\nSome 78% strongly agreed that it is paramount to know that they made a difference in their clients' lives,15% strongly agreed that it is paramount that they can retain a non-advisory relationship with their clients (with a further 32% somewhat agreeing), 95% strongly agree that they want their clients to know the firm they've chosen to take over from them is their parting good 'advice', and 100% strongly agree that they want their clients to feel listened to, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, 80% strongly agree (and 18% somewhat agree) that it is important that the firm that takes over is culturally aligned with their values and those of their clients.\n\n\"Of course, financial planners want to get a good price for their business. And so they should. However, these are businesses that have been built on nurturing relationships, some spanning several decades. So, it should come as no surprise that financial planners place so much importance on the acquiring firm having a good reputation for looking after clients â even that it Top Trumps the sale price,\" said Finli group chief distribution officer Simon Goldthorpe.\n\nGoldthorpe added: \"Of course, they can have both when it's the right fit! However, understanding and, importantly, appreciating that any deal is as much about emotions as it is about the headline figure and the mechanics of the sale is in everyone's best interests. These findings act as a timely reminder of the need to place equal weighting on both.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "The adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.\n\nThe adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.",
         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: âThe increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

         "There were 588 private equity deals announced or closed in 2024 in Italy.

This is calculated by BeBeez Private Data, BeBeez's private capital database, taking into account both investment and divestment activity and considering not only deals announced by funds, but also those organized by club deals of private investors and investment holding companies.

         "M&A process a 'disturbing event' for IFAs",
         "The acquisition process can prove a troubling event for staff and owners, experts told PA, but there are ways that buyers and sellers can best manage this.\n\nSpeaking to Professional Adviser, The Flower Group founder Gordon Flower labelled deals \"a disturbing event for IFA owners and the people involved\". Flower added that the acquisition process has \"an emotional toll on everyone involved, particularly those who are being acquired\".",
         "\"People are scared of losing their jobs,\" Flower explained.\n\nThe Flower Group was launched in July 2023 to support the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process for the wealth management sector. Last month (24 January), it unveiled its M&A support service for the wealth management sector, said to \"reduce transaction timelines by an average of six weeks\".\n\nFor those looking to acquire businesses, Flower suggested considering \"good client data\". \"Acquirers like to hear that a business cares about its clients, such as when someone remembers the small things about their clients, rather than viewing their clients as numbers,\" he noted. \"Listening skills are very important in this space.\"\n\nHe added: \"When you're looking to acquire a business, you need to think to yourself, âCan I see this business fit in with us?'\"\n\nFlower noted that many business owners fear losing value during acquisitions. \"They ask themselves, âIs this going to reduce my value?'\" he said.\n\nTo alleviate such concerns, The Flower Group helps prepare sellers for the demands of due diligence and supports acquirers with key insights into the cultural and operational dynamics of their targets.\n\nEnsuring cultural fit and human capital stability\n\nHoxton Wealth founder and CEO Chris Ball highlighted the importance of understanding whether the human capital within the business will remain post-acquisition.\n\n\"Are you buying someone's book that's retiring? If so, then it's important that if they're saying they're retiring, they actually retire,\" Ball explained. \"If they don't have a real reason for retiring, they may find it too difficult and emotional to leave and could return, which creates challenges.\"\n\nHe also stressed the importance of evaluating existing employees before completing the acquisition.\n\n\"If you're keeping the human capital, it's important to meet those people before you buy the business. You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their âbaby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this â often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to Â£3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locationsâsuch as whether employees will work remotely or in an officeâneed to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open â being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation â leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach â communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration â it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being âdone to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer â ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "Tallying losses on AIB stake after bank buys back my shares",
         "I received the proceeds of 13 AIB shares, having opted to sell these under the scheme announced by the bank for small shareholders some time back. The shares represent a huge dilution of the original shares which were acquired over many years between the early 1990s and roughly 2007.\n\nWould you know how I would go about calculating the capital loss on these shares in case I need to offset gains somewhere else? Some of the shares may have been acquired by way of scrip dividends, which adds to the complexity.",
         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those â¬13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of â¬73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank. The â¬5.65 a share offer â a 5 per cent premium to the market price â was simply the final insult in an investment that has proven catastrophic over the past 14 years.\n\nThose 250 shares that would have been worth â¬17.50 just before the consolidation announcement, and â¬8.75 on the last day the old shares traded on December 18th, became a single share which was worth â¬8.50 at the close of trading on December 21st. However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of â¬6,000 â â¬5,987.50 to be precise â at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way. At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of â¬78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares â shares given in lieu of cash dividends â the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the â¬18.98 a share the bankâs stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the â¬5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. Thatâs 2.26 cent. So your loss on that dayâs trade is almost â¬18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records â or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares â for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, youâll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYouâre talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain â because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price â for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

         "*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaicaâs general insurance sector.",
         "Earl Jarrett, CEO of the Jamaica National Group (JN Group), made the disclosure to staff earlier this week.\n\nâThe JN Financial Group will sign an agreement today for British Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) to purchase its shares in JN General Insurance (JNGI),â Jarrett wrote in a note circulated to staff on Monday. The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed âwithin the coming weeksâ and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that âall JNGI branches will continue to operate as usualâ leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition âin days, not weeksâ.\n\nâWeâre close to negotiating the final terms. But those negotiations are continuing,â Levy added.\n\nJNGI will continue to renew motor and property insurance through its branches and brokers as well as honour insurance claims until the sale is finalised.\n\nâOnce the sale is finalised, the JNGI portfolio, business, and locations will be fully managed by BCIC. All positions within JNGI will be made redundant; however, some JNGI employees will be invited to explore opportunities within BCIC,â Jarrettâs e-mail said.\n\nIt noted that JNGI employees and the National Workersâ Union, the bargaining entity that represents the workers, have been kept informed of the planned sale, adding that dialogue is ongoing regarding the future of the employees.\n\nLevy said he didnât know how many of the JNGI staff will be given positions at BCIC.\n\nâWell, a lot of the work weâll be doing once we sign the deal will be around filling out those details. So, at the current time, we donât really know,â Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\nâThe analysis that weâve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,â Levy said. âInsurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I donât think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.â\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCICâs position as one of the leading players in Jamaicaâs general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entityâs participation in the insurance market.\n\nâJN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,â Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised Â£20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bankâs push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\nâThe divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,â the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "The National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) has accepted one of Banc Sabadell's demands and will open the market test it is finalizing regarding BBVA's takeover bid for the Catalan bank to both business associations and trade unions, according to industry sources.\n\nThis was one of the requests of Sabadell's chairman, Josep Oliu, who has even compared the lack of participation of these agents in the market test to \"asking the fox if he wants the hens to run free\".",
         "During the in-depth analysis of the operation, known as phase two, the CNMC rejected the allegations of 79 associations and only accepted that of Sabadell, considering that it is the only one with a legitimate interest. Two of the organizations that submitted allegations, Foment del Treball and UGT, have filed appeals before the National Court, both of which have been admitted for processing.\n\nThe market test has not yet been launched, but some associations have already been informed that they will be taken into account. By opening the procedure, they will at least have the opportunity to express their opinion during this process on an operation which, they say, limits competition, especially in the SME business, and puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStructural conditions of conductThe market test is being launched after the agreement of commitments between BBVA and the CNMC, in which the behavioral guidelines set out by the opting bank are maintained, mainly related to measures such as maintaining branches except those that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters and commercial conditions for customers for a certain period.\n\nThe CNMC accepts BBVA's approach, although tightening the time commitments, which in some aspects go up to three years. This is a different approach to that advocated by Sabadell, which calls for structural measures and asks that the market test itself should ask the sector whether BBVA should sell assets in order to maintain competition.\n\nOnce the test has been launched, the sector's agents will have ten working days to reply, after which the CNMC's Competition Directorate will submit the final report to the plenary for approval of the opinion.\n\nIt is at that moment when the Ministry of Economy will have 15 days to decide whether to analyze the file and, within 30 additional days, submit it to the Council of Ministers, which may establish additional conditions to BBVA.\n\nBBVA is confident that it will be able to launch the takeover bid in June, although the next few days will be key to determine the speed of the process and whether, given the holiday break, the operation will be postponed until after August.",

         "ING's role (past, present and future) in BBVA's takeover bid for Sabadell",
         "ING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.\n\nThe entity has been very explicit in recognizing that it wants to grow in markets such as Spain, much more than what banks usually do before carrying out relevant operations. \"We want to grow in larger markets, such as Italy, Spain and Germany,\" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in early February. \"M&A is an option everywhere, if it fits our criteria,\" he added.",
         "Spain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio JuliÃ¡, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena RomÃ¡n as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena RomÃ¡n returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put RomÃ¡n in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique PiÃ±el as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

         "For family offices, high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) considering the purchase of luxury assets (in particular yachts, artworks and aircraft) there are multiple factors to consider, not least deciding on the optimum structure to purchase and hold such luxury assets.\n\nWhen purchasing a luxury asset, one of the first considerations should be the structure through which such luxury asset will be purchased and subsequently held. One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",
         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured âoff balance sheetâ and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from âlimited liability recourseâ meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise, currently not available to the general public.\n\nTax Neutrality: The BVI is tax neutral meaning that there is no income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax levied in the BVI. In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "Torres (BBVA) expects the CNMC to authorize the takeover bid for Sabadell in the \"coming weeks\" and conclude before the summer.",
         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper InformaciÃ³n in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",
         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide. The shareholder is king, just as everyone is king with their own property. When you want to sell your house, it is up to you to decide whether to sell it or not. Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del MediterrÃ¡neo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "BBVA defends the takeover bid for Sabadell: \"We do not expect the Government to impose a veto on the operation\".",
         "The Chairman and CEO of BBVA, Carlos Torres, expressed his satisfaction with BBVA's record annual profits, above 10,000 million euros, thanks to the improvement in all markets and business areas. This was another reason for him to defend the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, about which he commented that \"Europe needs larger banks to be able to make the necessary investments to maintain a sustainable position for the future. This operation gives us the opportunity to have more than 5,000 million in financing, which means paying more taxes, a greater global reach based on meritocracy and the creation of value for shareholders that the operation entails. Together we can achieve greater goals that would be impossible to achieve separately.",
         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at TelefÃ³nica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Ãlvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in TelefÃ³nica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the â¬0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of â¬0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate â¬5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents â¬0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa GÃ³mez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, GÃ³mez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

         "Smaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.\n\nSmaller scale private equity backed acquirers are expected to merge and consolidate in 2025, according to Louise Jeffreys, managing director at consultancy Gunner & Co.",
         "Jeffreys told FT Adviser she expected more changes to happen within the M&A market in the coming 12 months - and it would be the acquirers and consolidators themselves who might consolidate.\n\nShe said: âMany PE-backed acquirers took investment in 2019, so the PE houses will be on a countdown to exit their positions, and a wave of transactions is likely.\n\nâThe number of new entrant buyers at that point in time (approximately 15 firms) left many buyers competing over the same targets. As a result, most have not achieved the scale expected by their backers at this stage.\n\nâMergers will give the PE houses the opportunity to exit their positions with more scale and see a new set of investors into the market.â\n\n'We will walk away from a deal': how consolidators have become 'picky'\n\nJeffreys believed there would be three key themes that would dominate the M&A landscape in 2025, with the first being the number of firms coming to market.\n\nâThe buyer market is extensive â it is broad and deep and made up of a mix of firms seeking different outcomes from acquisitive growth.\n\nâThe market can absolutely support an uptick in firms for sale. However, there will be increased competition over the highest quality, and the risk that other firms fail to attract significant interest.\n\nâFurthermore, there is a risk a bottle-neck could occur in the FCAâs change in the team approving company sales. During Covid, we saw significant delays to deals due to the CIC taking significantly longer than anticipated, and if this happens again it may mean sellers looking to beat tax hike deadlines will not succeed.\n\nâIt could also lead to poor behaviour reported pre-budget, where it was rumoured some sales were going through without the necessary regulatory approvals,â she explained.\n\nJeffreys also predicted buyers would be putting significant focus on the integration of the firms they buy.\n\nIf supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted. Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the âbuy & buildâ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\nâThe consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\nâMany of the âbuy & buildâ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\nâThat further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.â\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labourâs first Budget for 14 years has had a âhuge impactâ on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\nâBADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\nâIt could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\nâFurthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale â potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,â she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

         "The acquisition of firms is a common practice in the consulting sector, with recent examples among the Big Four and large technology companies, such as EY with the purchase of Attalea Partners, Deloitte acquiring Keytree or Accenture integrating Axis Corporate. Although this approach is not usually the main driver of growth for these companies, there are already international firms such as McKinsey that are showing more and more interest in this type of strategy. In this scenario, Jungle, despite being significantly smaller than these large consulting firms, is positioned as one of the few firms that bases its growth strategy on a programmatic M&A, with the goal of acquiring up to four firms a year.",
         "This Spanish company, which is listed on the French market, but is considering listing in Spain next year, recently closed its fourth annual purchase, with the acquisition of Move Branding, which joins the other three consulting firms acquired this year: the technology firm MilÃº, the creative agency BUM and Liquid Lab, a technology consulting firm owned by the former CEO of Mobile World Capital Barcelona.\n\nBoth in this last acquisition and in the other 10 that Jungle intends to make from 2025 onwards, it is relying on the advice of Grant Thornton and the GÃ³mez Acebo law firm. In addition, for these future acquisitions, the consulting firm will allocate 40 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the company, led by AgustÃ­n Vivancos, has its own M&A department led by a creative person with a financial profile. This team analyzes a portfolio of almost 300 companies per year, of which they contact about 100 and end up negotiating with three dozen of them. Some of these acquired companies end up becoming spin-offs, as is the case of True, Meme or Libero Creative Club, specialized in soccer.\n\nSince 2022, the consulting firm has already added a dozen new acquisitions. With the constant growth in size, Jungle faces the challenge of acquiring larger and larger companies, which implies more significant investments.\n\nThe company expects to close 2024 with a turnover of $40 million To ensure the profitability of these operations, the firm uses a growth and integration methodology based on three fundamental pillars: 1,000-day strategic planning, weekly accountability and management focused on a maximum of three KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, Jungle recordedtotal revenues of â¬27.2 million, a 49% growth compared to the previous year. The consultancy projects to close 2024 with revenues of â¬40 million and an estimated EBITDA of â¬7 million.

Solvency position, broad product portfolio and investment income status are the key strengths of the company, even as its premium earnings remain causes for concern. A short-term economic outlook of Bahrain, a positive outlook for the non-life insurance segment in Bahrain and UAE, could provide ample growth opportunities for the company. However, risks related to online identity theft and hacking, fluctuations in interest rates, and intense competition could affect the companyâs business performance.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nSolvency\n\nInvestment Income\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nARIGâs broad product portfolio enables it to enhance its scalability to cater to the distinctive requirements of its clientele. The company offers a range of non-life and life reinsurance products and services across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Its portfolio of reinsurance products includes treaty reinsurance, life reinsurance, medical reinsurance, and property reinsurance. It also offers facultative reinsurance for specialty lines, such as casualty, engineering, marine hull, cargo, marine liabilities, and motor extended warranty. ARIGâs services include risk management, account handling, and claims payment services.\n\nSolvency\n\nSound solvency of the company strengthens its ability to borrow and repay the money, which in turn enhances its business operations. According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The companyâs insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloydâs portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrainâs GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the companyâs profitability. The companyâs investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the companyâs control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the companyâs operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the companyâs operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the companyâs portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Companyâs 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: á´ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. á´ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. á´ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company â¢ While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor âGulf Tamin Ltdâ was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. â¢ The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. â¢ As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Companyâs Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. â¢ The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholdersâ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the companyâs paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the companyâs shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIGâS REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIGâS INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, companyâs funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

         "* Barnes & Noble plans to open around 60 new stores in the US, says CEO James Daunt.\n\n* Daunt said it would be \"logical\" to consider a future initial public offering in London or New York.",
         "* Barnes & Noble was acquired by Elliott Investment Management for $683 million in 2019.\n\nJames Daunt, the CEO of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, said he would open about 60 new stores in the US.\n\nThe British bookseller boss told the Financial Times that he is considering a future initial public offering in London or New York as well as the expansion.\n\nThroughout 2024, 57 Barnes & Noble locations were opened across the US, which currently has approximately 600 stores. In the UK, 12 new stores were added. Speaking about additions in the new year, Daunt said to the FT that he plans to \"do that or more in 2025.\"\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest book chain in America. After he quit his investment banking job, Daunt launched Daunt Books in London in 1990 â where there are now about 10 stores. In 2011, he was appointed managing director of British bookseller Waterstones to help the struggling business, which faced growing competition from Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Waterstones was sold to Elliott Investment Management by Russian billionaire and publisher Alexander Mamut. Barnes & Noble was acquired by the same New York-headquartered hedge fund the following year for $683 million.\n\nDaunt was named CEO of both book retailers. He also continues to run his independent book chain in London.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble and Waterstones boss told the FT it would be \"logical\" to contemplate an IPO but that any plan would be based on Elliott's strategy for the future. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the FT reported there are no current plans to list the chains. However, it could be a possibility at a later stage.\n\nAt present, Daunt hopes to combine the IT and finance platforms at Barnes & Noble and Waterstones into one system.\n\nHe noted that it was a \"solid Christmas\" because as the holiday fell on a Wednesday, last-minute shoppers had the weekend before to purchase gifts.\n\n\"The last weekend and [December] 23-24 were exceptional on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he told the FT. \"It has been a good post-Christmas as well.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

         "5 Red Flags to Watch Out for in Small Business Acquisitions",
         "Recognize the warning signs to help avoid costly mistakes in your next merger or acquisition.\n\nNatalia Tkachenko-Horbachevska, an Entrepreneursâ Organization (EO) member in Ukraine, is the founder and CEO of Task Force language services, which CSA Research 2024 ranked in the TOP 5 fastest-growing language services companies globally. From her offices in Poland and Ukraine, Tkachenko-Horbachevska shared her U.S. growth strategy journey, which includes a lesson on mergers and acquisitions.",
         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. Youâre ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.âbut canât quite find the time because thereâs already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And thenâwar breaks out in your country.\n\nThatâs what happened to my company. I work in the field of language servicesâtranslations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldnât be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work. Peopleâs immediate concerns were fuel (to flee), food, and medicine.\n\nThe strategy of âclaiming more local market shareâ seemed irrelevantâI thought there would be no market left to claim. Thankfully, I was wrong, and we continue to work actively in Ukraine. I was in despair for the first two days of the war but then decided that despair is not productive, so I put all my energy into work.\n\nThus, in early 2022, we made a 180-degree shift. We chose Poland as our new home market. It was the only growing economy in Europe, close to Ukraine, and provided an inroad to the European market. From there, we could both help our fellow Ukrainian businesspeople and expand internationally. Poland would become our launchpad for selling services worldwide.\n\nWe needed to âlocalizeâ ourselves in Europe. Ukraine is its own world, and Europeâthe EU in particularâis another, with its own rules we had yet to learn. Our goal was to âbecome part ofâ Europe.\n\nThe fastest, most logical solution was to acquire a company. We explored potential targets in Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didnât have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, âIt doesnât matter when the client buysânow or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,â it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a companyâs sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, âIt seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I donât really track that.â The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performedâall data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the companyâs direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, itâs critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didnât have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Ownerâs resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasnât appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we havenât lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europeâyet.\n\nClick to view image.",

In a short statement, Retelit said the assets included in the transaction generated revenues of around EUR 160 million in 2024, without disclosing the financial terms agreed upon.\n\nThe B2B specialist did specify that the acquisition would serve to enhance its proprietary fibre-optic network by an additional 11,500 km to over 47,000 km, while adding a further 10 MW of power capacity to its national data centre infrastructure. It would also boost its suite of ICT infrastructure and services to support the innovation and the digital transformation of Italian businesses.",
         "The deal, which is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, will also result in over 360 existing domestic business clients of BT in Italy transitioning to Retelit. In 2023, the company acquired regional fibre operator BT Enia from BT Italia to boost its fibre and data centre footprint in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nBT has been looking to withdraw from Italy since booking a GBP 530 million charge in 2017 following a false accounting scandal, subsequently selling two business units to TIM in 2021.",

         "France's InVivo seeks Ukraine silos for postwar grain trading push",
         "PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - French agriculture firm InVivo is looking to acquire silos at Ukraine's Odesa port to bolster its global trading business and refocus on its cereal activities, its chief executive told Reuters.\n\nDespite massive destruction since Russia's invasion, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest grain exporters via its Black Sea ports in the Odesa region.",
         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processing,\" Blandinieres said.\n\nThat includes Soufflet Malt, one of the world's biggest producers of the barley-based beer and whisky ingredient.\n\nThe unit on Friday announced a 100 million euro investment to build a malt factory in South Africa with Heineken.\n\n($1 = 0.9161 euros) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Sybille de La Hamaide) ",

         "Spain is planning to introduce a 100% tax on the value of properties purchased by people who are not from the European Union (EU).\n\nSpanish prime minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the move would help address the country's housing shortage, the BBC reported.",
         "He said non-EU residents bought 27,000 Spanish properties in 2023 with many destined for the rental market.\n\nPre-election soundbite?\n\nSeila Sanches Lucas is a UK and Spanish-qualified lawyer at the international law firm Broadfield who helps clients buy and sell property in Spain.\n\nShe said: \"The proposal by the Spanish prime minister will be concerning for those that have already chosen to retire in Spain and for those considering a retirement in the sun.\n\n\"It is just a proposal at this point in time and is not guaranteed to make it onto the Spanish statute books.\n\n\"It would be interesting to know whether this proposal would extend to the entire country or to particularly regions. UK nationals who have already retired and living in Spain will also want to know whether this tax could be levied retrospectively.\"\n\nShe added: \"It should be noted that some consider the Spanish prime minister is politically vulnerable and this may simply be a pre-election soundbite to boost his popularity. Even if adopted, the legislative process in Spain is tortiously slow and it is perhaps a little early for UK nationals to worry about this proposal.\n\n\"If adopted, there are many other jurisdictions looking to attract wealthy retirees and investors. For example, Dubai has been called the âNew Marbella'.\"\n\nSpain has already set a date to close its so-called \"golden\" investor visa set up from 3 April this year. The visa previously gave foreign investors fast-tracked residency but will now be scrapped.\n\nFragomen is an immigration specialist law firm. Director Isobel Neilson said closing of the investor visa will be a \"huge blow for retirees from the UK looking to move to Spain\".\n\n\"They will now have to look to other passive routes to obtain residency such as the non-lucrative visa â this is unfortunately less flexible, does not allow the applicant to work (even remotely) in Spain and requires full-time residency (six months a year) to maintain the status.\n\n\"One of the requirements of this visa is that the applicant needs to evidence accommodation in Spain. This can either be through a lease or showing title deeds to a property in Spain.\n\n\"If the proposed 100% tax on homeownership for non-EU nationals were to be introduced our clients would most likely look to rent instead of buying or alternatively explore other more favourable EU jurisdictions offering similar status such as the D7 visa in Portugal or the elective residency permit in Italy.\"\n\nRead more: Retiring abroad: Helping clients get their place in the sun\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",
         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Gold currently trades 1.8% lower at $2,604.50 a troy ounce, with investors now waiting for U.S. PCE inflation data due on Friday. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n\n1104 ET - Brazilian assets are undervalued, \"but it will be challenging to reverse this negative trend,\" Santader economists write. The country faces a worsening fiscal situation, rising inflation and steep borrowing costs. The currency has lost 27% of its dollar value this year and the Ibovespa stock index is down nearly 10%. \"Local institutional clients are preparing for potential outflows by building up cash reserves, and foreign investors are also hesitant,\" Santander says. The economists expect persistently elevated risk premiums in the country. They say, however, that Brazil has a variety of competitive companies \"that are benefiting from secular trends.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1046 ET - The more cautious approach to interest-rate cuts signaled by the Bank of England feels risky, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

         "Deal In Brief",
         "Constantinsborg A/S (Offeror) has decided to make an all-cash voluntary public tender offer all shares in FirstFarms A/S (FirstFarms) (other than own shares held by FirstFarms and shares already held by the Offeror) (the Offer) for a cash price of DKK 84 per share of nominally DKK 10 (the Offer Price). The Offeror is indirectly owned and controlled by Heartland A/S (Heartland) The Offeror will offer DKK 84 for each share of nominally DKK 10, subject to adjustment for any dividends or other distributions declared or paid to the shareholders of FirstFarms prior to completion of the Offer. The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025. The Offer values FirstFarms' entire share capital at approx. DKK 936 million. Further, the Offer Price corresponds at least to the price at which the Offeror is entitled to convert its existing convertible loan and which was determined and negotiated between the Offeror and FirstFarms in connection with the issuance of the loan on 29 February 2024. Completion of the Offer will be subject to customary conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, but completion will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarmsâ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. According to the terms and conditions of the offer document, the Offeror will be entitled to extend the offer period. Following publication of the offer document, all shareholders in FirstFarms (except shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions) will be able to sell their FirstFarms shares to the Offeror during the offer period. FirstFarmsâ board of directors is required to prepare a statement explaining the board's view on the Offer and the reasons forsuch view. The statement must be published before expiry of the first half of the offer period. Because of her relations toConstantinsborg A/S, Lise Kaae will not participate in the preparation of the statement by the board of directors. The Offeror will announce the final results of the Offer no later than three business days after expiry of the offer period (which may be extended) and expects completion of the Offer in Q2 2025. The Offeror has appointed Kromann Reumert as its legal adviser in connection with the Offer.\n\nDeal Type     Acquisition\nSub-Category  100% Acquisition\nDeal Status   Rumour: 2025-02-11\n\n\nDeal Participants\n\nTarget (Company)    FirstFarms A/S\nAcquirer (Company)  Constantinsborg A/S\n\n\nDeal Rationale\n\n% Acquisition  100%\n\n\n(c) 2001-2016 Marketline.

         "*Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable",
         "14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable\n\nThe following is a press release from Fitch Ratings:",
         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

         "* Travel group collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal\n\nEY has been fined Â£4.9million by the Financial Reporting Council for its audits of Thomas Cook in 2017 and 2018.",
         "Thomas Cook collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a rescue deal, but now operates in the UK as an online-only travel agent.\n\nThe fine was originally Â£6.5million, but was discounted by 25 per cent 'for admissions and early disposal.' EY paid also paid the costs for the investigation.\n\nEY audit engagement partner Richard Wilson was fined Â£140,000, discounted to Â£105,000 for the same reason.\n\nThe FRC imposed sanctions on EY and Wilson over audits for the airline for the financial years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog said the airlineâs goodwill balance was significant, comprising Â£2.6billion across the whole group, roughly 40 per cent of total assets.\n\nThe breaches related to assessing Thomas Cook's goodwill impairment level and going concern status, as well as adequately considering the risk to EY's independence during the 2018 audit, the FRC said.\n\nFollowing an investigation, it was found that for both audit years, EY and Wilson failed to 'approach this audit area with sufficient professional scepticism to properly corroborate managementâs assumptions and estimates supporting the goodwill impairment model'.\n\nThe FRC said 'the failings' for this 'were particularly serious' for 2018 'given Thomas Cookâs deteriorating trading performance, which heightened the risk that the goodwill balance could be impaired.'\n\nClaudia Mortimore, FRC deputy executive counsel, said: 'EY and Mr Wilsonâs failure to challenge robustly and to apply sufficient professional scepticism in these crucial areas led to significant breaches of auditing standards in both audit years.\n\n'The failings in 2018 are particularly serious given Thomas Cookâs financial position and the heightened risks surrounding the audit work.\n\n'EYâs remedial measures together with the programme of non-financial sanctions are designed to prevent such failures being repeated.'\n\nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed in 2019 after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding more than 100,000 passengers overseas and leaving many without jobs.\n\nChinese company Fosun later acquired the company's brand, before selling it to Polish travel platform eSky Group last year.",

         "In early 2025, Igor Mazepa's Concorde Capital bought the oil and gas service company Beiken Energy Ukraine, the Ukrainian subsidiary of the Chinese Beiken, for more than $25 million, Forbes reports.\n\nMazepa plans to provide drilling services both in Ukraine and abroad. The acquired company has 8 drilling rigs and plans to receive $10 million EBITDA for 2025. The lifting capacity of the acquired drilling rigs is from 125 to 450 tons.",
         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "Everton face Bournemouth on Saturday but there is obvious focus on the business they may or may not be able to do in the January transfer window now they have new owners\n\nSean Dyche believes this is the first transfer window heâs had at Everton where he doesnât have to sell to balance the books.",
         "The Toffees boss insists any sales this month will be only if theyâre bringing in a better player. The club was finally taken over by the Friedkin Group last month when the American firm got Premier League approval.\n\nIt follows years of penny pinching when Farhad Moshiriâs wild spending dried up and left the Toffees stuck with financial problems which led to points deductions last season.\n\nThe club has sold star assets like Anthony Gordon, Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana since Dyche arrived two years ago. But now, ahead of todayâs clash at Bournemouth, he insists the only sales happening will be if it is to make room for better players as the new owners bring stability.\n\nâApart from the PSR thing, the stability is there so that has changed,â said Dyche. âThereâs not that need but you still have to work the right market. These guys [TFG] are certainly not wanting to weaken us. Itâs the rules, not the intent.\n\nâWhat youâre saying is kind of right but it [sales] has to make us stronger. We are not under any pressure to get weaker by selling players but what can you do to make us stronger\n\nâThat is the good side of having the stability the owners talked about. We donât need to do anything, that has changed. It is about decision-making. Within the guidelines of the PSR. If we can sell one and bring someone in, that is something we would have to look at.â\n\nRelegation battling Everton, who go to Bournemouth looking for their first win at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League, have yet to have any interest in their current squad this month.\n\nMisfiring forward Beto is one player who may be on the way out if the right offer comes along though as he has struggled to deliver while on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja is now fit to compete with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nâLetâs see what the market offers,â said Dyche. âWe have had no phone-calls, we are making lots of them to see what we can do, see what is around and what can open.\n\nâAt the end of the day, our situation here is that we certainly will not be letting anyone go unless we are needed to. Unless of course we can swap and change. We want to keep the squad, we have had injuries and been very stretched. We are certainly not looking to have players going out.â\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community \n\nand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

         "MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Demand from investors covered all the shares offered by Hotelbeds owner HBX Group in its initial public offering within hours, the bookrunner said on Friday, ahead of what is set to be the largest listing in Europe so far this year.\n\nThe Spanish travel technology company said on Thursday it intended to raise 725 million euros ($752.6 million) by selling new shares that would start trading on the Spanish stock market on Feb. 13.",
         "The demand also covered the so-called 'greenshoe option', an additional number of shares potentially offered to investors if demand is strong enough, the bookrunner said on Friday.\n\nThe company has set a price range for its shares between 10.50 euros and 12.50 euros, which would give the whole company a market value of between 2.66 billion euros and 3.03 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations based on the IPO prospectus.\n\nThe private equity-owned company has been planning an IPO for more than a year, Reuters has reported previously, and has recently been sounding out investors.\n\nHBX's shareholders include private equity firms Cinven and EQT, and Canada's CPP Investments. Existing shareholders intend to sell existing shares worth about 25 million euros combined, the company has said.\n\nHBX Group would be the first to launch a European IPO this year after a slight recovery in issuance last year.\n\nThat saw cosmetics and fashion group Puig and private equity fund CVC raising more than 2 billion euros respectively in Madrid and Amsterdam, but Europastry cancelling its market debut due to market instability.\n\n($1 = 0.9633 euros) (Reporting by Inti Landauro, Jesus Aguado and Tomas Cobos, editing by Aislinn Laing and Jan Harvey) ",

         "Investment platform says it is âhighly competitive in the roundâ\n\nAJ Bell insisted its pricing represented good value for money for its clients after it again lifted the amount it takes in interest on their cash balances.",
         "The investment platforms operator reported a 29 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record Â£113.3 million and set out plans for a Â£30 million share buyback.\n\nRevenues grew by 23 per cent to Â£269.4 million on the back of winning a net 66,000 new customers, taking its customer base to 557,000.\n\nThe company said that the net interest it earned from customer balances increased in the year to September, but declined to quantify it, saying that the run rate peaked in March.\n\nMichael Summersgill, chief executive, said the firm was highly competitive looking at âpricing in the roundâ. Interest it pays to customers on their balances ranges from 1.8 per cent for cash in a dealing account up to as much as 4.27 per cent for cash held in some pension accounts.\n\nâWeâre an investment platform. People donât come to us to hold cash,â he said. âWe give great value to our customers.â\n\nInvestment platforms have come under pressure to improve their pricing with the Financial Conduct Authority writing to all of them reminding them of their responsibilities under\n\nthe new consumer duty \n\n.\n\nFor years, platforms made no money on customer balances, with base rate close to zero. But rises in base rate to a high of 5.25 per cent throughout the year to July has delivered them lucrative windfalls. Base rate has since come down to 4.75 per cent.\n\nFavourable market movements during the year added Â£9.5 billion to total assets under management, while net customer inflows of Â£6.1 billion, a rise from Â£4.2 billion last time, pushed the total figure to Â£86.5 million.\n\nSummersgill said successful advertising had helped the group, pushing spontaneous awareness of the brand above 50 per cent from 30 per cent two years ago.\n\nAJ Bell is a Top 3 investment platform business, serving DIY investors directly through its direct-to-customer unit and serving another tranche indirectly through a platform for financial advisers. It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14Â½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. âOver the long term I wouldnât say weâll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.â\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than Â£800,000 a year ago to Â£6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: âThe long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.â\n\nPensions tax âis unworkableâ\n\nThe governmentâs plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bellâs chief executive has said.\n\nâIt is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,â Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: âIf the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,â he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased personâs estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise Â£640 million in 2027-28, Â£1.34 billion in 2028-29 and Â£1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: âMost estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first Â£325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to Â£500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and Â£1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\nâWe continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.â",

         "PAXMAN has carried out a directed issue of 1.9 million new shares, raising proceeds of SEK 123.5 million",
         "Stockholm: Paxman AB has issued the following news release:\n\nThe Board of Directors of Paxman AB (publ) (\"PAXMAN\" or the \"Company\") has, based on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024 and in accordance with the Company's press release earlier today, resolved on a directed issue of 1,900,000 new shares (the \"Share Issue\"). Through the Share Issue, PAXMAN will receive SEK 123.5 million before issue costs. The subscription price in the Share Issue has been set to SEK 65.0 per share through an accelerated bookbuilding procedure (the \"Bookbuilding\") conducted by Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ). The Share Issue was subscribed by several Swedish and international institutional investors, including Eiffel Investment Group and Unionen, as well as certain existing shareholders, including Alcur Fonder, Andra AP-Fonden, Aktia Asset Management and SEB Asset Management.",
         "As announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. Additionally, the Company has undertaken not to carry out or propose any additional issuances of shares or other securities in the Company, without the consent of Carnegie, for a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. The Company's lock-up undertaking includes an exemption for any consideration shares to be issued in connection with the potential acquisition of Dignitana.\n\nAdvisers\n\nCarnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner in connection with the Share Issue. Advokatfirman Delphi acted as legal adviser to the Company in connection with the Share Issue.",

         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in Â£10,000, Â£20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

         "VEF AB (publ) (âVEFâ or the âCompanyâ) has recently announced several portfolio exits and has significantly strengthened our liquidity position, with USD 45m* in cash and liquid positions. Following the completion of these exits, VEF initiates a new share buyback program for up to 5% of shares outstanding.\n\nThe Board of Directors of VEF has approved the initiation of a new share buyback program based on the mandate from the annual general meeting of the Company on May 14, 2024. The objective of this program is to provide the Company with the flexibility to enhance shareholder value by repurchasing shares at substantial discounts to NAV, where the potential internal rate of return (IRR) is highly attractive.",
         "Dave Nangle, CEO of VEF comments:\n\nâVEF shares continue to trade at a deep discount to our NAV, a NAV we comfortably stand behind. To drive shareholder value, buying back our stock at current levels, is one of the best uses of any excess capital we have. We expect to continue to buy back our shares and pay down our debt with additional exits until our discount to NAV narrows materially.â\n\nThe new buyback mandate, is subject to the following terms:\n\n* Share repurchases are to be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with Nasdaq Stockholmâs rules for issuers.\n\n* The Company may also buy back shares in block trades in accordance with applicable rules.\n\n* Share repurchases can be made on one or several occasions until the 2025 AGM of the Company.\n\n* VEF can buy up to 5% of outstanding shares in VEF.\n\n* Repurchases of shares are to be made at a per-share price within the registered interval for the going rate at any given time, which denotes the interval between the highest and lowest selling price.\n\nAs of today, the Company holds no repurchased shares.\n\n*Subject to settlement of funds and no material FX changes.\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nCathal Carroll, Investor Relations: +46 (0) 8-545 015 50\n\nAbout Us\n\nVEF AB (publ) is an investment company whose Common Shares are listed in Sweden.

         "Nearly two years after the outbreak of the so-called Factop case, the brothers Ariel and Daniel Sauer continue to be the focus of new legal actions by those who claim to be victims of the scheme of false invoices and irregular financing unleashed within the factoring company.\n\nThis Monday, the foreign investment fund \"EMF Microfinance Fund AGmvK\" of the Swiss fund manager Enabling Qapital filed a lawsuit against the brothers and main shareholders of Factop, for the crimes of fraud and forgery, as well as malicious use of a private commercial instrument.",
         "The vehicle claims to have been defrauded by the Sauer brothers who gave \"a misleading appearance of regularity with respect to the company\" at the time of signing a contract to grant financing for US$ 2 million to the factoring company, while they would have guaranteed the loan through ideologically false invoices.\n\nThis is not the first time that EMF has gone to court over Factop. The fund entered as one of the main creditors of the factoring company in its bankruptcy liquidation process, claiming, at that time, a debt of US$ 1,680 million granted to Factop.\n\nUnder the private debt strategy, EMF has been operating since 2008 providing loans to microfinance institutions in emerging markets.\n\nThe loan The relationship between EMF and Factop began on January 23, 2023, when the two firms entered into a loan agreement for US$ 2 million from the fund in its peso equivalent, i.e. some Ps. 1,642 million at that date.\n\n\"Factop assumed the obligation to repay the loan, establishing a net interest rate of 15.60% per annum,\" the complaint said.\n\nTo back the loan, Factop pledged a series of 101 invoices for a total value of, according to the document, just over $1,774 million or US$ 2.14 million at the date of the guarantee.\n\nIn detail, 80 of such documents were issued by Comercial Textil Ziko Limitada, owned by Ariel and Daniel Sauer, and the Topelberg family. Of these, 31 were received by Inversiones GuayasamÃ­n SpA, a company in which Daniel Sauer is the sole shareholder.\n\nAnother 26 were allegedly issued to Inversiones Rae SpA, a company that has filed a complaint against Textil Ziko and its shareholders for receiving invoices in its name for services that were never rendered, including the documents pledged to EMF, according to the complaint.\n\nMechanism of fraud In this way, the Sauer brothers, through Factop and other companies owned by them, would have created \"a mechanism of fraud aimed at obtaining financing from various entities, including EMF,\" said the complaint.\n\n\"This led our client (EMF), as a result of the deceit of which it was a victim, to dispose of a sum of US$ 2 million in favor of Factop, under an agreement for the restitution of the capital plus interest that was never fulfilled\", the document added.\n\nIn addition, \"the defendants, through various companies owned by them, issued ideologically false invoices that were later assigned to Factop and used by them to guarantee the obligations contracted with EMF under the loan agreement,\" the document added.\n\nThese invoices were used, according to the complaint, to \"simulate that Factop had sufficient guarantees to secure the loan, when this was not the case\".\n\nMeanwhile, the use of these documents would also have meant \"the impossibility of being able to collect the aforementioned invoices, considering that the recipients of these invoices are companies that have also claimed that they are false, stating that they were issued fraudulently, for services never rendered and without their knowledge\", it added.\n\nAs for damages, the complaint stated that it \"contemplates the amount effectively delivered to Factop\", i.e. US$ 2 million.

         "The impact of employer NICs hike on M&A valuations",
         "The adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.\n\nThe adjustments to employer national insurance contributions announced in the 2024 Autumn Budget have raised concerns across various sectors.",
         "However, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, particularly in industries dominated by high-margin businesses such as financial planning, the changes are unlikely to significantly impact valuations.\n\nWith financial planning being a service-led industry, typical profit-margins on small to mid-size firms range from 30-50 per cent, so while at a headline level wholesale changes such as an increase in employer NICs may seem shocking, in reality it has minimal impact to these firmsâ bottom lines.\n\nThe Budget made a number of changes to employer NICs, including lowering the annual per employee threshold from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000 and increasing the contribution from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nSome firms are being left better off\n\nSo for an employee earning Â£30,000 this constitutes an increase of Â£865 in employer NICs.\n\nHowever, the government has improved the employment allowance, knocking off the first Â£10,500 of contributions (up from Â£5,000).\n\nSince many owner-led financial planning firms have only a handful of staff, the increase in the employment allowance will significantly mitigate any impact the increases to contributions will have â with some firms being left better off.\n\nHigh-margin businesses, including financial planning firms, operate with significant buffers in profitability.\n\nThere are various factors at play that insulate them from changes to employer NICs:\n\n* Strong profitability\n\nHigh-margin businesses generate substantial earnings relative to their costs. For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees.

Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.â\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneurâs relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first Â£1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",
