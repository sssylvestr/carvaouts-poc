         "The fintech sector is sustaining its rapid expansion, with the market expected to grow to over $500 billion by 2028 – an annual growth rate of over 25%. As the sector has increased in size, startups have transitioned into the growth stage and the marketplace has become extremely crowded, with competition at an all-time high.\n\nThis is expected to lead to an M&A uptick, evidenced in the payments sector with Elite’s acquisition of Tranch and Neonomics’ purchase of Ordo already having closed this year.",
         "According to Victor Basta, Managing Partner at Artis Partners, the sell-side M&A and growth financing specialists for technology companies, significant consolidation should be expected in the fintech space, with founders on course for record exit values.\n\nBasta said: “An M&A spike is a certainty in the fintech industry in 2025, with firms reaching the ideal size for larger competitors to consider moving for an acquisition. We’re already seeing this trend take hold in the payments space, where scale is absolutely critical, necessitating additional support for mid-size companies from big players. The Tranch and Ordo acquisitions are likely to trigger a ripple effect through the wider market.\n\n“The key drivers here are competition and the time and cost required to gain new customers or clients. Inevitably, as fintechs scale the sheer number of new paying customers, or in the case of B2B larger and larger enterprise accounts, requires significantly greater resources. As the fintech market grows in concentration, firms will need the support of larger acquirers – sometimes direct rivals – in order to maintain operationality and achieve expansion.\n\n“Many of the companies either pursuing exits or proving attractive to buyers will already be able to demonstrate strong financial performance, due to their development relative to less mature companies in the market. Each segment of fintech is already separating the core group of future winners from companies less and less able to compete, creating scarcity value for those few future winners in each category.\n\n“As a result, this will drive up values, with perhaps 25-50 European fintechs now worth several times the valuation of only a few years ago, who are attracting strategic interest from buyers at M&A prices too attractive to pass up in the next 12 months.

         "The UK's plan to allow trading of private company shares on exchanges is doomed to fail, according to buyout veteran Jon Moulton.\n\n\"It will be a flop,\" the Better Capital founder told Financial News sister title Private Equity News, adding that the scheme would likely be too heavily regulated and fail to attract interest from private equity investors.",
         "The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in £10,000, £20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of ",

         "UK's private share trading plan will be a flop, says buyout veteran Jon Moulton; Pisces has come under criticism in recent weeks\nThe Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System, known as Pisces, proposed by the previous Conservative government and taken forward by Labour, is set to create a regulated secondary market open on a limited number of days each year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to provide more opportunities for investors and employees to sell down their holdings in fast-growing companies, which are generally staying private for longer.\n\n\"I very much doubt that it will be economically viable because the volumes are going to be very low,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You need quite a lot of millions [of pounds] before you have anything which justifies having members of staff, systems, processes.\"\n\nFor private equity firms, Moulton argued that Pisces would not offer enough liquidity to attract interest other than \"once in a blue moon\".\n\n\"Why would a private equity firm want this? You'll be trading in £10,000, £20,000 lumps,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that companies trading on Pisces venues would not be subject to market abuse rules and other detailed disclosure requirements.\n\nHowever, they would still need to disclose \"core information\", including financial statements, sustainability measures and major shareholders under current proposals. Critics say this too closely resembles London's junior stock market AIM.\n\n\"It's got great chunks of what's required to trade as an AIM stock. It's a less active market with much the same practical regulation as AIM and even less liquidity,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"You want something which is genuinely liquid, and Pisces sure as hell isn't that.\"\n\nPisces is one of several government measures designed to revive London's moribund IPO market by acting as a stepping stone to a public float. But some executives have warned it could encourage AIM companies seeking more concentrated liquidity to delist.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to help one jot, I really don't,\" Moulton said.\n\n\"Creating another bunch of pretty feeble companies coming out of the lower end of AIM and getting traded once a month doesn't achieve anything for anybody, except the very substantial professional costs of implementing it.\"\n\nInstead, Moulton called for a much wider reworking of the FCA's rulebook.\n\n\"We really need to rip up quite a lot of the rules,\" he said. \"There's no evidence that the stock market of the 1960s, total regulation virtually zero, was any more dangerous than the mass of regulation we've got today.\"\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLast week London Stock Exchange Group chief executive David Schwimmer struck a more positive tone. He said LSEG had seen \"a lot of interest\" from global private equity firms over the scheme.\n\n\"It's not just in the UK,\" Schwimmer said. \"It's from companies and private equity firms in the US, in continental Europe and in Asia.\"\n\n\"Private equity firms are looking for opportunities to get more liquidity in their portfolios and for their companies,\" he added.\n\nLSEG is one of several firms planning to operate a trading venue under the Pisces scheme. Others include specialist private share platforms Globacap and JP Jenkins.\n\nNasdaq Private Market, based in New York, has offered a platform for private share sales since 2013. CEO Tom Callahan told FN last month that he was considering expanding in Europe.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, told PEN that Pisces \"has the potential to increase both flexibility and secondary market options for private companies and investors\".\n\n\"From industry's perspective, the important thing is that requirements for the regime are nimble, practical and easy to use for companies and market participants alike,\" he added.\n\nThis article was originally published by Financial News's sister title Private Equity News\n\nWrite to Lars Mucklejohn at lars.mucklejohn@dowjones.com",

For example, financial planning firms often achieve profit margins exceeding 30 per cent, far outpacing the impact of incremental NIC adjustments. This ensures that even with rising costs, their core profitability remains intact.\n\n* Scalable cost structures\n\nMany high-margin firms leverage efficient cost structures, including scalable technology and lean operational teams. The marginal increase in NICs as a percentage of overall costs is minimal, making it easier for these businesses to absorb the changes without eroding their financial standing.\n\n* Attractive revenue models\n\nFinancial planning firms benefit from recurring revenue streams from advice fees and asset management fees. These predictable income sources further cushion the impact of rising employment costs and maintain stable cash flows, which in turn is a key driver of valuation in M&A deals.\n\nWhen asked what impact these additional costs will have on M&A valuations, one large scale buyer told me: “The increase in operating costs due to the 2024 Budget changes to employers NICs is highly unlikely to have any impact on the value we set for a business. Quality businesses are typically high-margin, and the competitive nature of the M&A market is such that credible buyers will hold their valuations to win deals.”\n\nA combination of factors\n\nValuations in M&A transactions are driven by a combination of factors, most of which outweigh concerns about marginal cost increases from employer NICs adjustments.\n\nThe most prevalent mechanism of valuing a business continues to be a multiple of recurring income, an approach that is not impacted by fluctuations in the operational costs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, buyers are essentially investors, choosing businesses that have the highest return opportunities, such as offering clients additional services, thus generating additional fee income.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell\n\nThe scale of opportunity to grow and generate a return on the purchase of a financial planning business is such that marginal increases in operational costs do not dampen the attractiveness.\n\nValuations in the market are improving on 2023, where inflation and the cost of debt had a significant impact on offers, with recurring income multiples dropping from an all-time high of 4x, to an average of 3.3x. The position has improved in 2024, with the average increasing to 3.5x.\n\nWhere the Budget is having an impact on the M&A market is the volume of owners looking to sell, to access the best business asset disposal relief rates (formerly known as entrepreneur’s relief).\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced that this form of capital gains tax relief would be cut in 2025 and 2026, rising from a 10 per cent taxation of the first £1mn of consideration to 14 per cent from April 6 2025, and again to 18 per cent in 2026.\n\nBADR has long been a significant incentive to sell a business, and many owners are looking to push sales through in the next 16 months to get the best rates.\n\nThe risk to any sale that is rushed is that the seller may not have the time to really choose the best buyer suited to their business and their clients.\n\nAnd so while they may find they save money in tax, they may not achieve the full value for their sale if the fit is not right for the clients.\n\nLouise Jeffreys is managing director at Gunner & Co",

You want to get a very good feel for them to ensure they align with your culture. Ultimately, you're acquiring them, so they need to fit within your ethos,\" he said.\n\nBall noted that mismanaging this aspect can lead to a fragmented business. \"If you don't get that bit right and you acquire lots of businesses, you end up with ten or 15 different businesses under one umbrella rather than a single, cohesive business,\" he added.\n\nAt Hoxton Wealth, Ball said alignment is key. \"Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. While people may have different thoughts here and there, we all adhere to the same three core values: hard work, no ego, and a growth mindset. When acquiring a company, these values must align from the outset.\"\n\nAzets Wealth Management group head of people, M&A, Sylvie Gale-Coudene echoed this sentiment, noting that mergers and acquisitions are as much about people as they are about financials. \"A strong cultural fit is often what determines long-term success, which is why both buyers and sellers should focus on alignment beyond just the numbers.\"\n\n\"For business owners considering a sale, it's essential to understand who they are selling to and how that organisation will look after their people. Many sellers see their business as their ‘baby' and want confidence that their team will be supported. The most successful sellers prioritise this – often above financial considerations.\"\n\nThree top tips to minimise employee concerns during advice acquisitions\n\nCatalyst Partners partner Roderic Rennison highlighted the importance of addressing employee concerns during acquisitions. \"The sale of an intermediary business brings obvious concerns for employees, whether advisers or support staff. It is both considerate to them and important for the acquirers, who will want to retain them, that careful thought is given to their needs and welfare,\" he said.\n\nFormed in 2018 by Rennison and John Chapman, Catalyst Partners works with IFA business owners looking to sell, in addition to those pursuing management buyouts, employee ownership trusts, and reorganisations. Between 2018 and 2022, it was involved in about 35 IFA sales, adding another ten to its tally in 2023, covering close to £3bn of assets.\n\nRennison outlined three key aspects to consider when acquiring: Communication timing, work arrangements, and salary and terms.\n\nTiming of communication: Employees should be informed once there is reasonable certainty that the deal will proceed, ideally after due diligence but before the transaction is made public. This timing allows for questions to be answered and issues resolved.\n\nWork arrangements: Clear expectations regarding working locations—such as whether employees will work remotely or in an office—need to be agreed upon in advance.\n\nSalary and terms: New salary structures and terms of employment should be communicated and agreed upon well before the transaction is completed. This is particularly crucial for advisers to ensure their continued motivation and commitment.\n\n\"In summary, effective communication, achieved via regular dialogue, is a key success factor in any deal,\" Rennison added.\n\nGale-Coudene further stressed that transparency is key. \"Selling a business with your eyes wide open – being honest about expectations, cultural shifts, and the reality of operating within a larger organisation – leads to smoother integrations.\"\n\n\"Selling a business can be difficult for owners who are used to complete autonomy in decision-making. That's why it's important for sellers to think ahead and consider what motivates them to go to work, what they want from the next stage of their career, and how they will contribute to success within a larger organisation.\"\n\nCreating long-term value through M&A\n\nCIL business services practice partner Tom Stevens told PA that while acquisitions can be unsettling, they should be seen as an opportunity to create long-term value.\n\n\"Success hinges on a structured approach – communicating clearly with employees, investing in learning and development, and ensuring HR processes support a smooth transition,\" growth consultancy partner Stevens said. \"Client relationships must also be actively managed, with clear account oversight and increased engagement to maintain trust.\"\n\nBeyond people management, Stevens emphasised the importance of operational efficiencies. \"Businesses that invest in technology, streamline operations, and take a data-driven approach to performance will navigate the transition more effectively,\" he explained. \"When done well, M&A isn't just about integration – it's about creating a stronger, more connected business that's set up for long-term growth.\"\n\nGale-Coudene reinforced this, stating that a well-handled acquisition requires clear, authentic communication to win hearts and minds. \"If people feel an acquisition is something being ‘done to them,' rather than something they are part of, engagement and retention suffer – ultimately weakening the value of the deal.\n\n\"Navigating this process successfully isn't just a science; it's an art that requires flexibility, understanding, and strong communication.\"\n\nRead more: All the advice firm acquisitions that have taken place in 2025\n\nTo view photo, click here.",

A cornerstone of our revised strategic plan is to increase the availability of personal service and wealth management solutions for a wider customer base.

In the future, Aktia will report both gross and net AuM, rather than only net.\n\nUpdated dividend policy:\n\nAktia’s goal is to offer its shareholders a competitive total return, including dividends, the amount of which depends on the Group's profit development as well as growth and investment needs. In addition, Aktia wants to ensure sufficient capital adequacy in changing market circumstances. Aktia's capital and dividend policy has been updated.\n\nUpdated dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, excess capital may be distributed to shareholders using e.g. extra dividends or share buy-backs.\n\n(Previous dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay out a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.)\n\nInvestor Event 27 February 2025:\n\nAktia invites investors, analysts and media representatives to an investor event on 27 February 2025 at 12:30 p.m. During the investor event, CEO Aleksi Lehtonen, together with other members of Aktia's Executive Committee, will present the company's updated strategic priorities and an overview of the acceleration programme for the implementation of the strategic plan with new financial targets.

An acceleration programme is being launched to drive the implementation of the strategic plan focusing on organic growth in wealth management.\n\nThe core of Aktia's growth strategy is to accelerate our journey towards becoming a unique, leading wealth manager empowered by a strong banking heritage.

The objective of the programme is to generate comparable operating profit annualised run rate improvements of approximately EUR 7 million by the end of 2025, and a total of approximately EUR 20 million by the end of 2026 -- aligned with, Aktia's new long-term financial targets. The programme is expected to generate one-off costs, which do not affect the comparable operating result, of approximately EUR 6 million in 2025. The costs relate mainly to external advisory services and are dependent on the financial performance of the programme.\n\n\"Our three strategic priorities are active wealth management, growth in our core segments and a first-class customer experience -- enabled by investments in digital development, streamlining our business processes, and developing the Aktia way of working. A cornerstone of our revised strategic plan is to increase the availability of personal service and wealth management solutions for a wider customer base. We intend to go beyond the established segment borders in the market and democratise private banking services. In this way, we want to give more customers the opportunity to benefit from our award-winning asset management, our peak competence in wealth management and our unique customer experience. With a robust financial basis, a unique market position, skilled employees and an ambitious leadership team, we are well equipped to deliver results and drive profitable growth. I strongly believe in our ability to achieve our new financial targets, especially with the acceleration programme now launched to implement our strategic plan,\" says Aleksi Lehtonen, CEO of Aktia.\n\nAktia's strategic priorities are:\n\n1. Active Wealth Management\n\nAs wealth transitions across generations, customers need accessible, sustainable financial solutions. Aktia helps customers grow and transfer wealth with clear, long-term plans and a holistic approach.\n\n2. Winning in Strategic Segments\n\nFinland's growth relies on bold investments, cross-generational legacies and work, and thriving communities. Aktia takes an active role by driving success in Premium, Private Banking, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and institutional segments.\n\n3. The Aktia Experience\n\nWe will stand out by specialising in attentive personal service for a growing customer base and by bringing them the Aktia experience. Skilled and committed employees work together to deliver tailored solutions and to respond to the customers' financial needs and goals.\n\nKey enabler: Powered by Data and Technology\n\nEnhancing our IT setup to enable growth in a scalable and efficient way.\n\nLong-term financial targets for 2029: \n\n\n   -- Comparable return on equity (ROE) over 15 per cent by 2029 \n \n   -- Assets under management over EUR 25 billion* by 2029 \n \n   -- Organic net commission income growth over 5 per cent per year \n \n   -- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio 2--4 percentage points above the \n      regulatory requirement. \n\n* This figure reflects gross AuM, corresponding to all AuM in the asset management business for which Aktia receives fee commissions. In the future, Aktia will report both gross and net AuM, rather than only net.\n\nUpdated dividend policy:\n\nAktia's goal is to offer its shareholders a competitive total return, including dividends, the amount of which depends on the Group's profit development as well as growth and investment needs. In addition, Aktia wants to ensure sufficient capital adequacy in changing market circumstances. Aktia's capital and dividend policy has been updated.\n\nUpdated dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, excess capital may be distributed to shareholders using e.g. extra dividends or share buy-backs.\n\n(Previous dividend policy: Aktia intends to pay out a dividend of approximately 60 per cent of the profit for the reporting period to its shareholders.)\n\nInvestor Event 27 February 2025:\n\nAktia invites investors, analysts and media representatives to an investor event on 27 February 2025 at 12:30 p.m. During the investor event, CEO Aleksi Lehtonen, together with other members of Aktia's Executive Committee, will present the company's updated strategic priorities and an overview of the acceleration programme for the implementation of the strategic plan with new financial targets.

         "I received the proceeds of 13 AIB shares, having opted to sell these under the scheme announced by the bank for small shareholders some time back. The shares represent a huge dilution of the original shares which were acquired over many years between the early 1990s and roughly 2007.\n\nWould you know how I would go about calculating the capital loss on these shares in case I need to offset gains somewhere else? Some of the shares may have been acquired by way of scrip dividends, which adds to the complexity.",
         "Mr GD\n\nThis is where investors need to hold on to good records in relation to when and where they put their money. We all overrate the powers of memory, especially in a case like yours where there are multiple share purchases over many years.\n\nWithout records, you can either find yourself in trouble with Revenue over capital gains tax unpaid or lose out on losses that can be used to defray capital gains on the sale of other assets. No one should get rid of their records until they have fully divested of stocks in particular companies or other investments and squared things up with Revenue.\n\nEven then, Revenue requires you to hold on to record for six years after the year the tax return relates to.\n\nAs you say, those €13 shares, for which you received the paltry sum of €73.45 when AIB earlier this autumn offered to buy back the holdings of any investor with fewer than 20 shares in the bank, were just a fraction of your original holding. The magic number of 20 was chosen because anyone with fewer shares than that would pay more in stockbroking charges to sell them that they were worth at face value.\n\nBack in 2015, the bank organised a share consolidation which saw every shareholder receive one new share for every 250 they owned at the time. So your 13 shares would originally have been 3,250 shares in the bank.

However, those 250 shares would have been worth just shy of €6,000 – €5,987.50 to be precise – at the pre-crash peak.\n\nMultiply that figure by 13 to get the value of your shareholding at various points along the way.

At peak, your holding would have been worth not far short of €78,000.\n\nBut the key for you is the price at which you acquired each set of the shares. For the scrip dividend shares – shares given in lieu of cash dividends – the price is the value at which the shares were trading when the shares were issued to you.\n\nIf, for instance, you bought on March 7th, 2006, at the €18.98 a share the bank’s stock was trading at, each share bought that day would now be worth 1/250th of the €5.65 you got in the odd lot buyout. That’s 2.26 cent. So your loss on that day’s trade is almost €18.96 per share.\n\nYou need to go back through your records – or contact your broker, who should also have records of your dealings in the shares – for the relevant dates, and strike prices at which shares were acquired. Allowing then for the 250:1 consolidation, you’ll be able to assess your loss or, less likely, gain on each transaction.\n\nIf you did not have a broker, some companies (or their share registers) are helpful in providing share prices if you can give them the dates they were acquired. But it is a time-consuming process, and not one on which you can count for support.\n\nYou’re talking about transactions over 17 years here, so I really do hope you kept the related paperwork. If not, it is quite likely that you will miss out on the opportunity to use losses accrued on this investment against any other asset sale gain – because you will not have the necessary detail for a tax return when you are looking to offset the losses. You would not have the transaction dates even if you could track down the share price – for instance, in old Irish Times print records of daily stock market coverage.",

Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows ",

         "UPDATE 1-Azimut targets March sale of 80% stake in fintech bank to FSI\n*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaica’s general insurance sector.",

The company is a 99.64 per cent subsidiary of JN Financial Group Limited, its parent company, which itself is 100 per cent owned by JN Group.\n\nJarrett, in that disclosure, said the deal should be completed “within the coming weeks” and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe JN Group did not immediately reply to requests for comments on the transaction when contacted by\n\nJamaica Observer.\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the sale to staff indicated that “all JNGI branches will continue to operate as usual” leading up to the finalisation of sale.\n\nPeter Levy, managing director of BCIC told BusinessWeek on Thursday that his company is expected to complete the acquisition “in days, not weeks”.\n\n“We’re close to negotiating the final terms.

So, at the current time, we don’t really know,” Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\n“The analysis that we’ve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,” Levy said. “Insurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I don’t think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.”\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCIC’s position as one of the leading players in Jamaica’s general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entity’s participation in the insurance market.\n\n“JN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,” Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised £20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bank’s push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\n“The divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,” the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business.

         "ING's role (past, present and future) in BBVA's takeover bid for Sabadell\nSpain is one of ING's most profitable and fastest-growing markets, but its size is small. The Spanish branch made a profit of 356 million last year, up 13% on the previous year, with a return on equity (ROE) of 20%, higher than Spanish banks. But the profit weighs less than 6% of the 6,392 million it earned on a global scale. ING has a limited presence in Spain, in a banking market with good prospects and in an economy that leads growth in Europe.\n\nIn this context, the group considered a deal with Banco Sabadell last year. In the midst of a hostile takeover bid by BBVA, the formula would have been a counter takeover bid. As El Confidencial has learned from market sources, the bank led by Steven van Rijswijk, and now directed in Spain by Alfonso Tolcheff, considered launching its own bid for its Catalan competitor since early last summer, when tensions between BBVA and Sabadell, on the one hand, and with the Executive itself on the other (it has positioned itself against the merger of BBVA and Sabadell), were more than evident for the development of the takeover bid. Neither ING nor Sabadell have commented on the matter.\n\nThe operation was piloted outside Spain. Specifically, from Amsterdam, the city where ING's headquarters are located. The bank hired at least one advisor to study the feasibility of the operation, according to market sources. After crunching the numbers, it decided to put the option on hold in September.\n\nIndeed, Sabadell's CEO, César González-Bueno, is very familiar with ING, where he has been for two periods. He led the launch in Spain and was responsible for the branch until 2010, when he became ING's regional head of Europe, and between 2017 and 2019. A year and a half after leaving ING, he took the reins at Sabadell.\n\nThe possibility of launching this operation, ING considered, would have had the support of the European authorities, who want transnational banking giants to be created. Although in this case, ING already operates in Spain, where it has a share of more than 5% in deposits and mortgages. If it were to buy Sabadell, it would be between 10% and 15%, depending on the segment. In addition, there would be no possible arguments from Sabadell or from other interested parties (regional governments or business associations) against the operation as a matter of competition.\n\nING made numbers until September, according to market sources, before it was known that the analysis of the authorization of the purchase of BBVA by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) went to a second phase that makes the timing of the operation unclear. BBVA expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, and Sabadell points to June.\n\nPending CNMC In any case, according to the same sources, ING is now pending the resolution of the CNMC, insofar as it may alter the profitability of the operation and provide an opportunity to re-consider the possibility of intervening with an offer. In addition, in the event that there are restrictions (remedies) that impose the sale of part of Sabadell's business, especially SMEs, ING would be one of the candidates to position itself as a buyer. Without going any further, on Friday, in the allegations presented by Sabadell before Competition, against the hypothetical merger with BBVA, the Catalan bank requested remedies of a structural nature.\n\nMeanwhile, ING is in the midst of repositioning its business in Spain. The former CEO of Spain and Portugal, Ignacio Juliá, left in September to join Santander. For several months, ING has been analyzing profiles inside and outside the bank, with Almudena Román as acting CEO, together with the consulting firm Russell Reynolds. Finally, it has opted for the local head of investment banking, Alfonso Tolcheff, for the position.\n\nWith this move, Almudena Román returns to her position as head of business development, with the task of opening up new segments in the Spanish market such as private banking or SMEs. Another proof of ING's hunger for growth in Spain, always under the impulse of Amsterdam. The group moved the management committee to put Román in charge of this new position, and returned Miguel Montes to Spain as head of retail banking.\n\nA boost in Spain? An eventual operation with Sabadell would be a definitive boost for ING in Spain. The margin of potential synergies is much lower than that of BBVA, but it is also a unique opportunity to position itself in the Spanish market. Sabadell is a bank of significant size, with a balance sheet of 240 billion, and no controlling shareholders. There is no other case like this in Spain. ING, on the other hand, has a balance sheet in the Iberian market of just under 24 billion. Just 10% more than Sabadell, although the profit was equivalent to 20% of the Catalan bank.\n\nING has a capitalization of 52 billion and a balance sheet of one billion euros, with an ROE of 12.6% and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.6%. In the case of BBVA, which is worth 72 billion euros on the stock market, its balance sheet is 770 billion euros, with higher profitability ratios. ROE is 18% and ROA is 1.3%. However, the market assigns greater risk (cost of capital) to BBVA due to its exposure to emerging markets. Mexico alone accounts for more than half of the profit. In the case of ING, it is lower, at 7.3 times. In the case of ING, it is 8.3 times.\n\nBe that as it may, ING has been a self-proclaimed M&A candidate across the main European markets, including Spain. Banks often hire external advisors to lead such deals, although they also rely on their own teams. ING is strengthening its investment banking, where it has brought in Spanish talent.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has brought in Enrique Piñel as an external analyst from London (with an indirect contract as a consultant), a well-known Spanish banker who has worked for 20 years at JP Morgan (he participated in the mandate for the sale of Popular, before its resolution) and who in his last position was managing director of financial institutions (FIG) for EMEA at Barclays. He was previously head of FIG Spain at Barclays and JP Morgan, so he knows the ins and outs of Spanish banks inside and out.\n\nING is called to participate in the concentration processes of markets such as the Spanish one, as its CEO recently acknowledged. And one of them is the one between BBVA and Sabadell. The Dutch bank has Sabadell in its sights. It studied launching an operation with the Catalan bank and does not rule out considering it again, according to sources in the know. In the meantime, it is rearming in Spain and reinforcing its M&A capabilities.",

         "For family offices, high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) considering the purchase of luxury assets (in particular yachts, artworks and aircraft) there are multiple factors to consider, not least deciding on the optimum structure to purchase and hold such luxury assets.\n\nWhen purchasing a luxury asset, one of the first considerations should be the structure through which such luxury asset will be purchased and subsequently held. One of the most popular choices is to hold the luxury asset through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).",
         "What are SPVs and Why Use Them?\n\nSPVs are a corporate structure (typically a BVI business company) commonly set up for the exclusive purpose of purchasing and holding a luxury asset, and they tend to (depending on the exact SPV structure used) provide for a combination of some or all of the following benefits:\n\nFinancing Flexibility and Limitation of Risk: An SPV can potentially be structured “off balance sheet” and be used to secure financing for a new luxury asset at the level of the SPV without increasing the debt/security for the broader corporate group or HNWI/UHNWI directly (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nTransfer/Sale: Should there be a desire in the future to sell or transfer the luxury asset, this can be done with minimal fuss as the SPV could be sold as a self-contained entity. This may also have additional benefits as permits and registrations (in the case of yachts and aircraft) may not need to be transferred and will remain in the name of the transferring SPV.\n\nLimited Liability: Most SPVs will benefit from “limited liability recourse” meaning that in the majority of cases, an existing group company or the HNWI/UHNWI will be insulated from the financial risk in the event of default or other issues relating to the luxury asset (subject to any guarantees given).\n\nThe BVI as a Leading Jurisdiction of Choice for a Luxury Asset SPV\n\nThe BVI is one of the most popular jurisdictions of choice for incorporation of an SPV to hold luxury assets. The BVI is one of the world's leading offshore financial centres and offers the following key benefits:\n\nReputation: The BVI is one of the most recognisable and well-established offshore financial centres, which provides a significant advantage when dealing with key counterparties (such as financiers, banks and insurers) when compared to lesser-known offshore financial centres which may claim to offer similar benefits.\n\nConfidentiality: The details of any shareholders/members of a BVI SPV are, unless elected otherwise",

In addition, other than in very specific circumstances, the BVI does not impose any stamp duty on the transfer of shares of an SPV should it be sold as a self-contained entity holding the luxury asset.\n\nBritish Overseas Territory: Ultimate executive authority in the BVI is vested in the monarch of the UK, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nLegal System: The BVI has a recognised and well-developed common law legal system with ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.\n\nLegislation: The BVI has a very flexible and user-friendly companies legislation when compared to some onshore/other offshore jurisdictions.\n\nBanking: The BVI is not subject to any exchange controls and uses the US Dollar as its primary currency.\n\nCosts: Compared to most other well-established offshore financial centres, there are low costs of forming and then maintaining an SPV within the BVI.\n\nStructure of BVI SPVs\n\nThe primary legislative act governing companies in the BVI is the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) (BCA) which makes provision for several different types of BVI companies. However, when it comes to a BVI SPV established to hold luxury assets, the common choice is a BVI business company limited by shares (BVI BC) which has the following key features:\n\nA BVI BC has separate legal personality, meaning that in the majority of cases, the liability of a shareholder/member is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on such shares. Such amount is in most cases, either nil or only nominal.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the BVI BC can be entrusted to the directors of the company (who generally do not need to be physically based in the BVI).\n\nThe SPV will have a registered agent and registered office based in the BVI which can handle certain day-to-day administrative aspects of maintaining the BVI BC on a client's behalf, reducing administrative burdens*.\n\nThe BVI BC is a popular form of SPV widely recognised globally.\n\nThe BVI BC is not subject to any statutory financial assistance restrictions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPurchasers of yachts, artworks, aircraft and other luxury assets face important decisions regarding the structuring of such acquisitions. With multiple options available including various forms of SPVs in differing corporate domiciles, purchasers should seek out a jurisdiction that offers the best mix of quality, flexibility, administrative convenience, cost/ tax efficiencies and international acceptance. The BVI has and continues to lead the way as the jurisdiction of choice for sophisticated family offices and HNWI/UHNWI looking to establish acquisition and holding SPVs for their luxury assets, offering a flexible, tax-efficient and secure place to do business.\n\nConyers has a wealth of experience in this space, having acted on some of the most prominent acquisitions, financings and disposals of luxury assets via BVI SPVs. Conyers advises on BVI law through offices in the BVI and the key financial centres of London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nFootnote\n\n1.

         "BBVA's chairman, Carlos Torres, expects the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to make a decision in the \"coming weeks\" on the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell. In this sense, he estimates that the operation could be concluded before the summer, provided that this body gives the go-ahead to the proposal, which is still being analyzed in phase two. This is what he said on Thursday during a forum organized by the newspaper Información in Alicante. \"Perhaps now I am reluctant to give a concrete forecast because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of the CNMC and it is the authority that has to resolve when and how it sees fit,\" he said.",
         "In this sense, he underlined BBVA's \"commitments\" in proposing this operation and recalled that, if the CNMC finally issues a favorable resolution, it will be the moment when each of Sabadell's shareholders will have to decide \"if they want to exchange their shares in this very attractive equation\" that, in his opinion, his institution offers, \"with a very positive impact on the earnings per share\" that those who take part in the exchange will have, according to Torres.\n\nAsked whether he fears that the government could impose conditions on the takeover bid that would force BBVA to desist, he pointed out that \"the important thing is that Banco Sabadell's shareholders can make their decision and that anything that prevents this from happening would not be a good thing. And he added: \"If the question is whether I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid that there is anything in the way that could prevent the shareholders from making the decision, which is what has to happen when there is a well-functioning capital market\".\n\nTorres commented that \"it is true that the Government has a role that can watch over other considerations other than competition, defense, national security, environment...\", but he pointed out that he does not believe that \"there is anything in this operation, especially considering the commitments\" that have been presented and that \"they deal with social inclusion\" and an \"action plan\".\n\nTorres stressed that it is the CNMC that analyzes the operation, \"as has been done in the mergers that have taken place in the financial sector in our country and in none of them has there been anything that prevented them from being carried out\".\n\n\"I trust that the shareholders will be the ones to decide.

Any interference in this process is not good in a market economy like the one we have, in which ownership is the one that should decide, once someone has analyzed it,\" he added.\n\nDuring his participation in the forum, Torres stressed that \"size matters\" in the banking and financial sector, as well as in other areas such as telecommunications, energy, digital and technology, because \"Europe needs larger companies capable of competing\". \"That's a bit of the rationale behind the operation,\" he added, and then went on to stress the \"search for efficiency through size.\" He also assured that, although with their differences, Sabadell and BBVA are two \"complementary\" banks: \"We like the Spanish geography and we want to grow here. It is a commitment to the regions where Sabadell has a greater presence, such as Catalonia and the Valencia region, as well as Asturias and other regions of Spain\".\n\nAsked for an assessment of Banco Sabadell's decision to move its headquarters from Alicante (Comunitat Valenciana) to Sabadell (Catalonia), the BBVA chairman assured that his entity views it \"naturally\" and that it \"does not affect the takeover bid at all\". In this sense, he pointed out that BBVA respects the decision of this return, \"which corresponds to the board of Banco Sabadell\": \"In the same way that they decided in their day, as they themselves say, to leave Sabadell, now they have decided to return. Perhaps it has to do with the political and social environment that exists now in Catalonia compared to the one that existed when they made the decision to come here -to Alicante-. I understand the impact that this may have symbolically in Alicante, but as far as the operation is concerned it does not affect it at all. Our commitment is total with the territories in which we are\".\n\nOn the other hand, Torres has asserted that BBVA is \"very aware\" of the history of Sabadell in the Valencian Community and in Alicante, \"above all\" because of the integration of Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo (CAM). Thus, he assures that \"he takes into account the symbolism that this entails\" and that, consequently, the entity \"will be sensitive to this aspect\".\n\nOn this point, he stressed BBVA's \"commitment\" to a \"multi-territorial model\", which includes points such as \"Bilbao, Madrid, Sant Cugat, Malaga and Alicante\", regardless of the headquarters that this entity has in other parts of the world. \"I can not specify anything now because it would be premature, precisely because we would also like to work with the Sabadell team on what makes sense and that takes time, but the commitment is that we are a stable and committed partner of the Comunitat and its companies and our goal is to continue to grow in presence and business in Alicante,\" he said.\n\nOn another matter, asked if he is concerned about the duplication of offices for personalized attention and about what will happen to the employees of both entities if the takeover bid materializes, Torres said that \"it is not an operation to reduce employment a lot\", although \"obviously there is always an impact\" in the face of duplicities \"where savings can be made\".\n\n\"In this operation the staff reduction component has much less weight, it is not non-existent, but it has much less weight,\" added the BBVA chairman, who subsequently emphasized his commitment \"not to close any branch that is more than 300 meters from any other\" belonging to his entity and \"not to abandon any municipality in which there are fewer than three competitors\".",

         "The Chairman and CEO of BBVA, Carlos Torres, expressed his satisfaction with BBVA's record annual profits, above 10,000 million euros, thanks to the improvement in all markets and business areas. This was another reason for him to defend the takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, about which he commented that \"Europe needs larger banks to be able to make the necessary investments to maintain a sustainable position for the future. This operation gives us the opportunity to have more than 5,000 million in financing, which means paying more taxes, a greater global reach based on meritocracy and the creation of value for shareholders that the operation entails. Together we can achieve greater goals that would be impossible to achieve separately.",
         "During a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at Telefónica, he defended, as a shareholde",

         "BBVA defends the takeover bid for Sabadell: \"We do not expect the Government to impose a veto on the operation\".\nDuring a press conference for the publication of the bank's latest results, Torres emphasized that \"the markets have responded very well both to the results and to the offer we have made for Sabadell, which is supporting our valuation and underpins Sabadell's share price, whose value is supported by the offer we have made\". He also defended that \"we are talking about premiums of 50% over Sabadell's average share price, and 30% with respect to the price on the day the takeover bid was presented. If we compare this with the premiums offered in other similar operations, around 0%, I believe that our offer is more than attractive. With the exchange we are proposing, the attractiveness for Sabadell's shareholders is enormously relevant\".\n\nThe bank's chairman said that he expects Competition to give a definitive response to the operation in the coming weeks, \"and that it should be positive and unconditional\". This, he believes, would be the key, since it would avoid the possibility of the Government deciding on the operation and imposing additional conditions. \"Only on one occasion has the government intervened in an operation of this type after a resolution without conditions from the CNMC, in the integration of La Sexta in Antena 3\", so \"we do not think that it will be done in our case if Competition approves the operation without conditions\". Nor does it contemplate that the Government will impose on the entity to sell Sabadell's businesses that pose competition problems, mainly in Catalonia. \"We do not contemplate it. Nor do we contemplate a veto on the part of the Government,\" he said.\n\nThe Chairman of the entity paid special attention to the tax impact on the entity, after pointing out that \"the Group has faced a tax payment of some 5,000 million in taxes in all the areas in which we operate\", including the 285 million of the impact of the temporary levy on the banks that it has had to face in Spain.\n\nRegarding the changes at Telefónica, he defended, as a shareholder with a 5% stake in the operator, the replacement of José María Álvarez-Pallete as chairman by Marc Murtra because \"it was thought that it was good to move on to a new stage\" in the group. Torres recalled that BBVA has been an investor in Telefónica for more than two decades, and has always worked with \"a vocation of permanence and loyalty to its management teams, and will continue to do so\", considering its presence in the share capital of the technology company as \"a non-strategic financial investment\".\n\nTorres confirmed that a final cash dividend of 0.41 euros gross per share will be proposed in April 2025. This is in addition to the €0.29 already paid in October as an interim dividend, totaling a cash dividend of €0.70 charged to 2024 earnings for the bank's shareholders, 27% more than the 2023 dividend. In total, BBVA will allocate €5,027 million to shareholder remuneration, charged to 2024 results, which represents €0.87 per share and a payout of 50%. It also announced that it will launch a share buyback program for an amount of 993 million euros.\n\nPreviously, in a meeting with analysts, BBVA's chief financial officer, Luisa Gómez Bravo, has shared some of the bank's forecasts for the business in Spain, including a low or mid-single-digit increase in lending volume by 2025. The bank maintains its positive outlook for the country, with loan portfolio growth above the industry average. In addition, it expects the fixed-income portfolio to contribute, together with the increase in loan volume, to offset the fall in the interest margin that will occur due to the low interest rate environment.\n\nIn fees and commissions, Gómez Bravo believes that they will register low single-digit growth, after the \"extraordinary\" performance recorded in 2024. Expenses will grow \"slightly\", although below inflation, so that the efficiency ratio should remain at around 36%. The cost of risk will remain \"stable\" or slightly below the current 38 basis points.\n\nRegarding Donald Trump's new presidency in the US and its impact on Mexico, BBVA has defended that the country's differential factors \"will not change\". He believes that it will be impacted if tariffs are imposed, as well as the Mexican peso, but that Mexico has \"structural advantages\" that will allow it to \"move forward\".",

Louise Jeffreys, Gunner & Co\n\nShe explained how things had changes since 2019, when firms such as IWP opened the market up to the ‘buy & build’ strategy. This is where PE-backed acquirers buy multiple regional hubs, and then grow those hubs, in part through further small-scale acquisition.\n\nThis strategy focused on a de-centralised model, with hubs operating within their existing framework and differently to their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\n\nBut Jeffreys said recent legislation has changed the gameplay.\n\n“The consumer duty, and the concept that a client in Manchester should receive a like-for-like service and charging structure to a client in Bristol has put paid to that model.\n\n“Many of the ‘buy & build’ acquirers have taken serious time and attention in the past 12-18 months to integrate what they have bought, and the days where a seller can stipulate they want minimal changes for clients are largely over.\n\n“That further strengthens the work quality M&A advisers do.”\n\nImpact of the Budget\n\nJeffreys felt Labour’s first Budget for 14 years has had a “huge impact” on the M&A market, specifically changes to Business Asset Disposal Relief.\n\n“BADR has long been considered an important element in timing a business sale, as it maximises the take home of the sale consideration.\n\nAs a result of the announced changes, many business owners are bringing forward their sale plans to improve their take home position. This has a number of potential impacts on the market.\n\n“It could affect supply and demand of businesses available to buy. If supply significantly increases buyers will get pickier and it is likely valuations could be impacted.\n\n“Furthermore if a vendor is looking to rush through a sale, they may not take the necessary steps to ensure they are choosing the right partner, which almost always impacts their ability to achieve the full value of the sale – potentially off-setting any gain they have achieved,” she explained.\n\nalina.khan@ft.com",

The company's major products and services include:\n\nProducts:\n\nTreaty Reinsurance\n\nLife Reinsurance\n\nMedical Reinsurance\n\nProperty Reinsurance\n\nCasualty Reinsurance\n\nEngineering Reinsurance\n\nGeneral Accident Reinsurance\n\nMarine Liabilities Reinsurance\n\nMarine Hull Reinsurance\n\nCargo Reinsurance\n\nServices:\n\nRisk Management\n\nClaims Payment\n\nAccount Handling\n\nArab Insurance Group (ARIG) is a provider of life and non-life reinsurance products and services. Solvency position, broad product portfolio and investment income status are the key strengths of the company, even as its premium earnings remain causes for concern. A short-term economic outlook of Bahrain, a positive outlook for the non-life insurance segment in Bahrain and UAE, could provide ample growth opportunities for the company. However, risks related to online identity theft and hacking, fluctuations in interest rates, and intense competition could affect the company’s business performance.\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nSolvency\n\nInvestment Income\n\nBroad Product Portfolio\n\nARIG’s broad product portfolio enables it to enhance its scalability to cater to the distinctive requirements of its clientele. The company offers a range of non-life and life reinsurance products and services across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Its portfolio of reinsurance products includes treaty reinsurance, life reinsurance, medical reinsurance, and property reinsurance. It also offers facultative reinsurance for specialty lines, such as casualty, engineering, marine hull, cargo, marine liabilities, and motor extended warranty. ARIG’s services include risk management, account handling, and claims payment services.\n\nSolvency\n\nSound solvency of the company strengthens its ability to borrow and repay the money, which in turn enhances its business operations. According to the Central Bank of Bahrain, the company is required to maintain a solvency margin of US$2.4 million in FY2023. ARIG reported capital available of US$235.0 million, which was well above the requirement. Its excess capital available over the required solvency margin was US$218.1 million in FY2023. As a result, it reported a solvency ratio of 9,235.9%, compared to 9,841.1% in the previous year.\n\nInvestment Income\n\nARIG reported an improvement in its investment income in FY2023, its net investment income creased to US$14.7 million from US$1.6 million in the previous year. The growth was majorly driven by an increase in Cash and bank deposits and investments designated at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in investment income could have a positive impact on its ability to meet policy claims.\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nPremium Earnings\n\nARIG reported a decrease in premium earnings, which indicates a decline in demand for its offerings. The company’s insurance revenue decreased to 18.1% to US$ million in FY2023 from US$ million in the previous year. The decline in insurance revenue resulted primarily from the shareholders' decision to stop underwriting reinsurance business. Additionally, there was no insurance income from Lloyd’s portfolio in FY2023, compared to US$2.1 million in the previous year. The decrease in premiums can be attributed to decline in renewals of existing policies and the selling of new policies.\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nGrowth in Insurance Industry in Bahrain\n\nThe company could benefit from the growth in the insurance industry in Bahrain. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the insurance industry is expected to reach BHD238.8 million in 2025. The gross written premium of the life and non-life insurance segments is expected to reach BHD72.1 million and BHD166.7 million, respectively, in 2025. increase in PA&H, property, and motor lines and an increase in the number of active policies are likely to lead to growth.\n\nShort-Term Economic Outlook: Bahrain\n\nThe company is likely to benefit from the positive outlook for the economy in Bahrain, which could create favorable market conditions and enhance the performance of the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors in the country. According to the International Monetary Fund's October 2024 report, Bahrain’s GDP is forecasted at 3.2% in 2025. The growth is expected to be facilitated by expansion of the Sitra oil refinery, and growth oil industry.\n\nGrowth in General Insurance Segment in the UAE\n\nThe general insurance segment in the UAE offers significant growth opportunities to the company. According to in-house research, the gross written premium of the general insurance segment is expected to reach AED40,748.6 million in 2025. The increase in tourism and digitalization, increase in property, and personal accident and health insurance business lines will likely aid growth.\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nIntense Competition\n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could hamper the company’s profitability. The company’s investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive investments such as municipal and corporate bonds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to the monetary policies of government, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the company’s control. Such volatile interest rates could affect the company’s operating performance as its income and investment returns depend on interest rates.\n\nRisks Related to Online Identity Theft and Hacking\n\nThe company uses information technology in its business transactions for maintaining databases of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes personal data, income details, social security numbers, property information, and much more. It also stores data on businesses and has an overview of their assets. As a result, the company’s operations are subject to online identity theft and hacking. Although its online portal operations contain diverse security mechanisms, they are still vulnerable to unauthorized attacks (break-ins or denial-of-service attacks), zero-day security holes and similar disruptions caused by hackers. The extent of internet security is dependent on the quality of hardware and software, which may not protect the company’s portal from unauthorized attacks, resulting in break-ins and other disruptive system failures.\n\nIntense Competition\n\nARIG operates in an intensely competitive reinsurance market, which may adversely affect its market share and profits. The company competes with various reinsurance companies based on the factors such as premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered, products and services provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, reputation, selling effort, perceived financial strength and the experience of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be written. Some of the major competitors of the company include Gulf Reinsurance Ltd, RGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited, Hannover ReTakaful B.S.C., and Trust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSC, and The Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co.\n\nGulf Reinsurance Ltd\n\nHannover ReTakaful B.S.C.\n\nRGA Reinsurance Company Middle East Limited\n\nThe Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co\n\nTrust International Insurance and Reinsurance Company BSc\n\nA joint statement by Mr. Saeed Mohammed AlBahhar, the Chairman, and Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Alkarbi, Director of the company is given below. The following statement has been taken from the company's 2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors of Arab Insurance Group (B.S.C.) (Arig or Group) present the Company’s 43rd Annual Report along with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. As you are aware, at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 13 August 2020, the decision to cease writing business was taken and this decision had a significant impact on the strategic direction and future of the Company. The annual report needs to be read in light of this decision of the EGM.\n\nThe significant developments during the year on shareholders decision to divest their shares in the company or sale of re-insurance portfolio are as below: ᴏ Following the appointment of investment banker for the divesture of holding in Arig by the current shareholders, the Company did not receive any binding proposal in spite of extension of the period to submit the same. ᴏ Instead, the Board received two non-binding proposals from one of the bidders which significantly undervalued the net worth of the Company. The Board on evaluation rejected both proposals. ᴏ The Board decided to pursue sale of insurance portfolio to speed up the runoff and is in the final stages of appointing an international broker to lead the sale.\n\nOffer to acquire 10% of the shares of the Company • While the appointment of the broker for the sale of portfolio was being finalised, the offer from a potential investor “Gulf Tamin Ltd” was received for acquisition of 10% of the shares of the Company. The proposal was by investors who had earlier completed the due diligence for the sale of the company. • The regulations relating to such offer requires that Arig or the Board does not take action that would be deemed to be frustrating the offer and therefore finalizing the appointment of the broker for sale of reinsurance portfolio was put on hold. • As required by regulations, the Board appointed an independent professional advisor to advise the board as to whether the offer is fair and reasonable. The professional independent advisor had come up with a value of US$ 1.37 per share and came to the conclusion that the offer of US$ 0.53 was not fair and not reasonable and the same was published as part of the Company’s Board Circular issued to the shareholders. Accordingly, the Independent Professional Advisor advised the Board not to recommend acceptance of the offer by the Shareholders. • The offer was not successful and the shareholders who accepted the offer remain shareholders of Arig, the Company also incurred additional cost of US$ 80,000 in addition to the time executives spent on the offer.\n\nGroup Performance\n\nArig achieved positive financial results for 2023 by managing its reserves and favourable investment returns with a net profit amounting US$ 14.0 million attributable to shareholders (2022: Net profit US$ 29.2 million) representing an average return of 4.81% on average shareholders’ equity. Consequently, the Board has recommended a cash dividend of 20% on the company’s paid-up capital (20 cents per share), which yet remains subject to approval of the company’s shareholders during the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The profit is mainly due to a combination of higher investment income, lower reinsurance loss experience and an emphasis on reducing costs. The Group reported total investment income of US$ 14.7 million (2022: US$ 1.6 million); a reflection of the prevailing high interest rate. The staff count at Arig parent stood at 50.\n\nARIG’S REINSURANCE POSITION The Group implemented IFRS 17 that resulted in an accretion of US$ 12.5 million of transitional impact on retained earnings. The total insurance contract liabilities stood at US$ 97.0 million (2022: US$ 112.6 million) primarily due to reduction of liability for incurred claims and claims paid. The overall insurance service result was a profit of US$ 2.6 million (2022: US$ 19.6 million) a reduction of 87% primarily due to less favourable claim experience compared to 2022.\n\nARIG’S INVESTMENT POSITION Arig Investment policy is a conservative one, so as not to risk the shareholders equity as well as the interests of policy holders. Group Investment Assets stood at US$ 393.4 million in December 2023 (2022: US$ 393.2 million) as follows: US$ million 2023 2022 Cash 219.6 215.1 Fixed maturities 162.3 164.1 Alternative investment 11.0 13.5 Investment in associates 0.5 0.5 Anticipating the end of the hike in interest rates, the Board as per the recommendation of Management had directed that new investments are considered with a focus on short term US Treasury. Taking advantage of the prevailing high interest rates, company’s funds are being placed in short term deposits.\n\nThe Board takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister, for their wise leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Directors further extend their thanks to our business partners, clients, staff and shareholders for their support and cooperation throughout the year.\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\n2 Shenton Way\n\n#13-02, SGX Centre 1\n\nSingapore City\n\nSGP\n\n65 65366618\n\n65 65366619\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nBrighton Place\n\nGround Floor, Shoplot No. U0215\n\nJalan Bahasa\n\nLabuan\n\nLabuan (Federal Territory of)\n\nMYS\n\n60 87 442899\n\n60 87 451899\n\nArab Insurance Group\n\nUnit 12C, 12th Floor Raffles Tower\n\n19 Cybercity\n\nEbene\n\nMUS\n\n230 466 0112\n\n230 466 0114\n\nArig Capital Limited\n\n4th Floor\n\nMitre House\n\n12 14 Mitre Street\n\nGBR\n\n44 20 3207 0081\n\nGulf Warranties W.L.L\n\nPO Box 5209\n\nDubai\n\nBHR\n\n973 4 3355347\n\n973 4 3355679\n\nwww.gulfwarranties.com\n\nTakaful Re Limited\n\nDIFC, Dubai International Financial Centre\n\nThe gate district, Precinct building 3, level 4, Tenancy 3\n\nP.O.

From her offices in Poland and Ukraine, Tkachenko-Horbachevska shared her U.S. growth strategy journey, which includes a lesson on mergers and acquisitions.",
         "Imagine the situation: Everything is going great in your business on the domestic market. You’re ranked among the top 10 key players, and want to expand to the U.S.—but can’t quite find the time because there’s already so much work. You hold a strategy session with your team and decide to first focus on taking a larger local market share from competitors over the next three years. And then—war breaks out in your country.\n\nThat’s what happened to my company. I work in the field of language services—translations, interpretation, and localization, to be precise. Our domestic market, Ukraine, collapsed in an instant (though not for long) when the war started in February 2022. During the first few days, I thought our services wouldn’t be needed anymore, and that it was time to urgently look for a new line of work.

In the language services business, where many companies are small, young, and without complex corporate structures, the many difficulties we encountered prohibited us from buying a company.\n\nTo benefit other companies looking to merge or acquire a small business, here are five red flags that made us reconsider making an offer:\n\n1. Lack of a sales function.\n\nSince people generally prefer buying from local companies, we, as foreigners, searched for a business with an established sales function. The companies we explored either didn’t have one or relied on the owners to generate sales. A few businesses had a client relationship development function vaguely resembling sales, but without key performance indicators. When we heard, “It doesn’t matter when the client buys—now or six months from now. The key is to build relationships,” it horrified me. After all, employees expect their salaries monthly, not biannually, right? Another red flag was when all of a company’s sales were tied to the owner and would disappear if they left.\n\n2. Poor financial reporting or no separation of personal and company finances.\n\nOne owner shared, “It seems like last year we earned a bit more than the year before, but I don’t really track that.” The comment made us uneasy. For a well-considered acquisition decision, we wanted to see well-organized financial statements in an international format. The absence of such data made it difficult to evaluate the company and make a reasonable offer.\n\n3. Absence of essential acquisition data.\n\nFor us, it was important to know which client sectors and industries the company served, how it segmented clients, and how well each individual service performed—all data points that a finance department can prepare. Such data are crucial for identifying potential synergies with a target company. However, not all potential acquisition targets were able or willing to provide such information. On our end, with a clear focus on key client sectors, we need to understand the company’s direction before moving forward together.\n\n4. A Luddite mindset.\n\nIn the language services field, it’s critical to view technology as part of your service offering or to approach your services through the lens of technology. The industry is evolving rapidly, and clients expect innovation, speed, and better pricing. A mismatch in understanding market expectations could pose serious challenges to collaboration and integration post-acquisition. The companies we spoke with didn’t have a dedicated technology function, which we considered a significant gap.\n\n5. Owner’s resistance to change.\n\nNaturally, we encountered offers for partial acquisition, where the owner wanted to retain a share in the company and, ideally, control over it. That wasn’t appealing, as we understood that a mismatch in corporate cultures and existing approaches would pose a significant risk post-acquisition. If the previous owner stayed, the risk of resistance to change would increase dramatically, and improving efficiency would prove more difficult.\n\nThough we haven’t lost hope and are still exploring options, we have not achieved our goal of acquiring a company in Europe—yet.\n\nClick to view image.",

         "Fibre operator Retelit, owned by Spanish infrastructure fund Asterion, has reached a preliminary deal to acquire BT's remaining operations in Italy, confirming earlier reports. In a short statement, Retelit said the assets included in the transaction generated revenues of around EUR 160 million in 2024, without disclosing the financial terms agreed upon.\n\nThe B2B specialist did specify that the acquisition would serve to enhance its proprietary fibre-optic network by an additional 11,500 km to over 47,000 km, while adding a further 10 MW of power capacity to its national data centre infrastructure. It would also boost its suite of ICT infrastructure and services to support the innovation and the digital transformation of Italian businesses.",
         "The deal, which is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, will also result in over 360 existing domestic business clients of BT in Italy transitioning to Retelit. In 2023, the company acquired regional fibre operator BT Enia from BT Italia to boost its fibre and data centre footprint in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nBT has been looking to withdraw from Italy since booking a GBP 530 million charge in 2017 following a false accounting scandal, subsequently selling two business units to TIM in 2021.",

         "InVivo, one of Europe's biggest grains firms since its takeover of French peer Soufflet in 2021, wants to join potential post-war investments in Ukraine to make the country a supply base, as it competes with global merchants in the Middle East and China, CEO Thierry Blandinieres said.\n\n\"We may consider buying port silos and developing a more attractive supply chain through Odesa for cereals,\" Blandinieres said in an interview.\n\nThe group might build silos but its preference is to acquire existing facilities, he said.\n\nInVivo would expect to tap lenders like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to help fund deals in Ukraine when reconstruction efforts begin, he added.\n\nSilo construction has been observed on farms in Ukraine, along with land acquisition deals, suggesting preparations for a post-war future, he said.\n\nInVivo, which generated sales of 11.7 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in the year to June 30, 2024, is already present in Ukraine through malt production, farm supplies and trading.\n\nControlled by 167 French farming cooperatives, InVivo has been looking to diversify its grain sourcing, supported by the opening of trading offices outside Europe, most recently in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat could see the group's trading go from an 80/20 mix of French and non-French supplies to 50/50 within 10 years, Blandinieres said, adding sourcing outside France has helped InVivo cope with a dire French harvest last year.\n\nOn the demand side, InVivo aims to expand sales to Saudi Arabia and re-establish a foothold in Egypt, where French wheat has lost market share to Russia and other Black Sea origins.\n\nThe trading push aligns with InVivo's focus on grain-related businesses, highlighted by its sale of Bioline AgroSciences to investors led by Eurazeo, which generated 70-75 million euros, he said.\n\nThe group may sell a stake in its wine business Cordier amid a downturn in the French sector.\n\n\"Our priority for the future is wheat and barley worldwide, and cereal processin",

         "1228 ET - Banks' concerns about potential new Basel III Endgame capital standards have reduced their appetite to keep commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets.Instead, they are selling off more exposure to real-estate loans in the form of commercial-mortgage-backed securities, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Issuance of CMBS is on track to more than double this year compared with 2023 issuance, Pendergast says. She adds that if the new Basel rules fizzle under the Trump administration, banks' real-estate lending appetite may return. The White House turnover will bring \"some friendlier folks in D.C. on the regulatory front,\" she predicts. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)",
         "1208 ET - After Wednesday's hawkish Fed projections, markets are expecting interest rates to remain higher into next year. Higher rates could continue to place a drag on commercial real estate valuations and lending into 2025, says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council. Before the pandemic, many landlords for office buildings, apartment complexes and the like grew accustomed to loans that charged interest below 4%--but lending rates are now often closer to 6% or 7%, Pendergast says. Tighter Fed policy will continue to constrain the prices that real estate investors can expect when they market properties they want to sell, she says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1125 ET - Gold prices extend losses in evening trade in Europe, after the latest U.S. data showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated, largely due to greater exports and robust consumer spending. U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.8% seen in earlier estimates and 3% growth registered in the second quarter. The report came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, but signaled fewer cuts next year due to sticky inflation and the economy's continued resilience.

Any positive impulse to demand would allow firms to pass on more of the large increase in labor costs they face to customers by raising prices, keeping inflation higher for longer, he says. Until now, the bank's focus has been squarely on inflationary pressure, which has been higher than expected since the last meeting. But the three dissenters from the BOE's December hold suggest high rates risk a \"large output gap\". However, above-target inflation limits room for cuts ahead, with rises in the minimum wage and higher taxation on employers to come, Wishart says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n1016 ET - The Bank of England will have to balance keeping inflation low with ensuring the economy doesn't weaken too much, Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm says in a note. This is likely to result in a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in 2025. \"The BOE has indicated that approximately two rate reductions are expected next year,\" he says. This \"underscores the BOE's commitment to carefully balancing inflation control with economic stability in an uncertain environment.\" (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)\n\n1014 ET - Sterling's fall against the euro after the Bank of England's 6-3 vote to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday will probably be temporary, Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen says in a note. While three BOE members voted for a rate cut, the central bank retained its guidance for a gradual approach to monetary policy easing. \"The still cautious guidance delivered today highlights the more gradual approach of the BOE compared to European peers,\" she says. That supports the case for EUR/GBP to move lower. Relative U.K. economic outperformance and tight credit spreads also argue for the exchange rate to fall. EUR/GBP rises 0.4% to 0.8270.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1012 ET - Bond markets are adjusting to the new Fed outlook, but many investors seem to be turning even more hawkish than the central bank. After yesterday's rate cut, the Fed's target range for the fed-funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%. Officials forecast only two more trims next year, taking the range to 3.75%-4%. CME's FedWatch tool shows a hold in January priced at more than 90%. A cut to 4%-4.25% only appears as the highest probability for the FOMC's May meeting. Odds are naturally more varied for December 2025, but most odds are on the target range ending the year at May's level or higher. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1005 ET - Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he's met with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, and intends to talk to the CEOs of the country's chartered banks as he gets up to speed quickly after his surprise appointment to lead the treasury. LeBlanc says PM Justin Trudeau asked him to take over as Finance Minister after the shock departure of Chrystia Freeland due to policy differences with the Canadian leader. In an interview with Canada's Herle Burly podcast, LeBlanc says the government's fiscal position \"isn't terrific,\" but recent indicators offer \"encouraging\" signs that the economy is heading in the right direction. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @PaulVieira)\n\n1002 ET - The Bank of England's policy update Thursday tilts more towards favoring future interest-rate cuts as three members voted against its decision to leave rates steady, Monex Europe's Nick Rees says in a note. The three policymakers who preferred a rate cut included new BOE member Alan Taylor. This suggests the balance of opinion has shifted towards favoring rate cuts since his appointment, Rees says. While the BOE highlighted inflation persistence, it also flagged weakening activity indicators and appeared \"notably dismissive\" of Tuesday's stronger-than-expected wage data. \"With this in mind, we are also retaining our call for 100 basis points of easing next year, likely to be delivered at a one-cut-per-quarter pace.\" The BOE could cut rates again in February. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)\n\n1001 ET - The Bank of England will cut interest rates quicker than investors expect, Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory says. The 6-3 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with the minority wanting to reduce rates, showed the BOE was more open to cutting rates than had been expected, she says in a note. Weak U.K. economic activity appears to be weighing increasingly on policymakers' minds. Members voting for an immediate rate cut expressed concern that sluggish demand created a risk of inflation falling too far below the 2% target, Gregory says. The BOE also appears to have downplayed the significance of the sharp rise in private-sector pay growth, highlighting that it \"tends to be volatile,\" she says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)\n\n0933 ET - Fed officials have projected inflation not reaching the central bank's 2% target before 2027 and they expect interest rates to be cut only twice next year. However, a potential resurgence of inflation could not only limit the Fed's ability to continue the rate-cutting cycle, but even drive it to raise rates, ITR Economics' Lauren Saidel-Baker writes. CME data show markets are mostly pricing a Fed hold until May, with the possibility of only one cut in 2025.

The Offeror is indirectly owned and controlled by Heartland A/S (Heartland) The Offeror will offer DKK 84 for each share of nominally DKK 10, subject to adjustment for any dividends or other distributions declared or paid to the shareholders of FirstFarms prior to completion of the Offer. The Offer Price represents a premium of approx. 16.67% compared to the closing price of DKK 72 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 10 February 2025 and a premium of approx. 17.96% compared to the volume-weighted average share price of DKK 71.21 on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S in the three-month period from 11 November 2024 to 10 February 2025.

Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends, regardless of the results of the Offer, to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The Offeror made its first investment of DKK 97.2 million in FirstFarms in February 2024 through a directed issue of shares and the issuance of a convertible loan to FirstFarms with a principal amount of DKK 89.1 million. Reference is made to FirstFarms' company announcement of 29 February 2024. Since then, the Offeror has continuously increased its ownership interest in FirstFarms. The Offeror has come to the conclusion that a delisting of FirstFarms’ shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S will be in the interest of FirstFarms and FirstFarms' shareholders. FirstFarms' shares are traded in limited volumes, and a delisting will give FirstFarms increased strategic and operational flexibility and reduce administrative burdens and costs associated with a listing. The Offeror therefore intends to seek a delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S regardless of the results of the Offer, expectedly by presenting a proposal for delisting in accordance with Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S' rules at FirstFarms' next annual general meeting on 29 April 2025. Ifthe Offer is not completed before the record date for FirstFarms' next annual general meeting, the Offeror intends to request FirstFarms' board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting at which a proposal for delisting of FirstFarms' shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S may be considered. The Offeror does not intend to initiate a compulsory redemption of other shareholders in FirstFarms, even if after completion of the Offer the Offeror may be entitled to do so. Thus, the Offeror's intention with the Offer is to obtain the greatest possible support for a delisting at the general meeting and to give FirstFarms' shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares before the general meeting if they wish to do so. Furthermore, the Offeror intends to convert its convertible loan into shares in FirstFarms before the record date for the general meeting. The Offer will be made subject to customary conditions for completion of the Offer, including receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. According to the Offeror, the transaction will require customary merger clearance in Romania and Slovakia andFDI approval in Romania. The Offeror has initiated the work on filings relevant for the transaction. However, completion of the Offer will not be subject to any minimum acceptance level The Offeror will fully finance the Offer with cash and debt. The Offeror's parent company, Heartland, has through its bank ensured full financing of the Offer subject to customary terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of the Offer will be set out in an offer document which will be published after approval by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four weeks from. The offer document will, subject to certain restrictions, be made available on FirstFarms' website. The offer period is expected to expire four weeks after publication of the offer document but may be extended to ensure that all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. According to the terms and conditions of the offer document, the Offeror will be entitled to extend the offer period. Following publication of the offer document, all shareholders in FirstFarms (except shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions) will be able to sell their FirstFarms shares to the Offeror during the offer period. FirstFarms’ board of directors is required to prepare a statement explaining the board's view on the Offer and the reasons forsuch view. The statement must be published before expiry of the first half of the offer period. Because of her relations toConstantinsborg A/S, Lise Kaae will not participate in the preparation of the statement by the board of directors. The Offeror will announce the final results of the Offer no later than three business days after expiry of the offer period (which may be extended) and expects completion of the Offer in Q2 2025. The Offeror has appointed Kromann Reumert as its legal adviser in connection with the Offer.\n\nDeal Type     Acquisition\nSub-Category  100% Acquisition\nDeal Status   Rumour: 2025-02-11\n\n\nDeal Participants\n\nTarget (Company)    FirstFarms A/S\nAcquirer (Company)  Constantinsborg A/S\n\n\nDeal Rationale\n\n% Acquisition  100%\n\n\n(c) 2001-2016 Marketline.

         "Fitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance",

         "*Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable\nFitch Ratings-New York-14 March 2025:\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (BK) at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed BK's operating subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. This rating action follows Fitch's annual review of the U.S. Trust and Processing banks.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nVR Underpins IDR: BK's IDR is driven by its 'aa-' Viability Rating (VR), strong franchise, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity. These attributes are offset by Fitch's assessment of the company's weaker earnings and profitability, and capital and leverage, relative to similarly rated banks. The Outlook is Stable, as we expect BK's credit fundamentals to remain in line with its current ratings, despite our expectations for a weaker economy in 2025.\n\nLeading Franchise Supports Ratings: The ratings are supported by BK's leading franchise in the global trust and custody segment; competitive position in asset and wealth management businesses; and dominant position in securities clearing. The bank's business model produced a high level of relatively stable fee-based revenue (of about 76.8% of total revenue) in 2024, which Fitch views favorably. The scale and breadth of product offerings in businesses with high barriers to entry result in strong and sticky client relationships.\n\nStrong Risk Culture: Fitch believes BK has strong controls and effective oversight across all risk domains, with a conservative risk culture embedded across the organization. Fitch considers the company's operational risk, its main risk factor, to be well managed, supported by a low operational loss history. Cyber risk is also an important risk factor for BK, given its significant role in providing market infrastructure, particularly in the U.S. Treasuries market within its Clearance and Collateral Management business.\n\nLow Credit Footprint: BK's loan book, at 16% of total assets, is among the lowest of Fitch-rated U.S. banks. Fitch considers outstanding and off-balance sheet credit exposure to be high quality, with exposures primarily to financial counterparties with strong collateral. The investment portfolio holds limited credit risk with 99% of the portfolio rated at or above 'AA-'. Office commercial real estate drove net-charge offs to 12 bps of total loans in 2024; BK's exposure to this segment is limited at around 10% of risk-based capital. In the Fed's 2024 severely adverse stress test scenario, provisions of loan losses of $1.6 billion represented one of the lowest loss severity rates (2.4% of total loans) among the 31 reported banks.\n\nOperating Margin Growth: BK's fee-centric business model is inherently balance sheet-light and leads to strong performance in operating profit/RWA, which is Fitch's core earnings and profitability benchmark. Operating profit to RWA increased to 3.49% in 2024, compared to 2.46% and 2.53% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by a mix of cost optimization, a more developed cross-selling strategy, as well as favorable market conditions. An FDIC special assessment in 2023 primarily accounted for 37 bps of the yoy increase in the ratio. BK's fee revenue is moderately exposed to movements in market levels, and, absent similarly supportive market growth, Fitch expects modest operating income growth in 2025.\n\nThe upgrade of BK's earnings and profitability score reflects execution towards its medium-term financial goals, which Fitch believes will offset structural fee compression in its core custody business. Growth in the bank's higher-margin Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management businesses provide diversification away from revenues tied to market levels. It also supports further upside on the earnings and profitability score over time.\n\nSolid Capital Levels: Fitch considers the bank's capital, measured by common equity Tier 1 (CET1), adequate, particularly in the context of our view of the bank's relatively low-risk balance sheet. CET1, at 11.2% at 4Q24, is above the bank's medium target of 11%. Tier 1 leverage, BK's binding capital constraint, declined to 5.7% in 4Q24, driven by capital distribution consistent with management's guidance and higher average assets on the back of deposit growth. Fitch anticipates BK will distribute around 100% of earnings in 2025 and maintain a CET1 of around 11%, assuming no significant changes in its accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) position. These levels would be consistent with management's guidance.\n\nHigh Balance Sheet Liquidity: Fitch considers BK's low-risk investment portfolio and highly liquid balance sheet profile a key rating strength, complemented by high levels of cash balances and a reputation as a safe haven for deposits. The average loan-to-deposits ratio for 4Q24 of 24.2% is among the lowest among Fitch-rated banks globally. The core business as the world's largest custodian, and the bank's growing Treasury Services business bring in significant levels of operational and noninterest-bearing deposits. BK's deposit base has proven countercyclical during times of market stress. The rating also reflects strong access to global capital markets and high level of contingent liquidity.\n\nRating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\nBK's ratings would be at risk if its CET1 ratio approaches or dips below 10% for several quarters in the absence of a credible plan to improve the ratio to levels consistent with recent years (i.e. at, or near, 10%). Fitch expects the bank to maintain Tier 1 leverage above regulatory minimums. A capital level below the regulatory well-capitalized minimum at either the holding company or operating company could lead to a lower rating.\n\nThe ratings could be negatively affected by outsized deterioration in the level and volatility of earnings. Should the bank's level of annualized operating profit/risk-weighted assets fall below 1.5% for several quarters, Fitch may revise the Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs to Negative or downgrade the VR and Long-Term IDRs.\n\nFitch believes the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would be a large, idiosyncratic technological (including cyber), counterparty or operational loss leading to reputational damage that causes clients to withdraw assets from the bank. Fitch believes these risks are well monitored and controlled but also inherently difficult to predict and quantify. A large incident that causes a loss equivalent to 5% of revenue or greater would likely prompt Fitch to consider a negative rating action.\n\nAlthough not expected, if specific protections within BK's legal structure do not allow for uninterrupted liquidity availability from the holding company under business as usual, the holding company's VR and IDRs could be notched down accordingly.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\nThe ratings are already near the top of the scale for Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs of 'ns' reflects Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation provides a framework for resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of/or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support.\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: BK's senior debt ratings are aligned with the firm's IDRs, as a default on these obligations equates to a default of the holding company.\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: The subordinated debt and hybrid securities are notched down from a common VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The preferred stock is notched four levels below the VR of 'aa-', which serves as the anchor rating. The rating is notched two times for loss severity and two times for nonperformance. Consistent with Fitch's base case for notching subordinated debt of bank holding companies classified by the Federal Reserve as Category I, II, or III, the rating is notched two levels below BK's VR for loss severity.\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: Fitch affirmed the Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) for BK and its main operating banks as they either have significant derivatives activity or are counterparties to Fitch-rated structured finance transactions. The DCRs are at the same level as the respective companies' LT IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. Therefore, the ratings will move in line with the IDR.\n\nOTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nGovernment Support Rating (GSR): In Fitch's view, BK and its subsidiaries' GSRs would be sensitive to any change in U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch believes is unlikely;\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: The long-term and short-term deposit ratings for BNYM are sensitive to any change to BK's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs;\n\nSenior Debt Ratings: Senior debt ratings are sensitive to any change in BK's IDRs;\n\nSubordinated Debt and Other Hybrid Securities: Subordinated debt and other hybrid ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in BK's VR.\n\n14 Mar 2025 17:56 ET \nPress Release: Fitch Affirms The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's IDRs at 'AA-'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable -2-\n\nDerivative Counterparty Ratings: The DCRs of BK and its main operating banks are primarily sensitive to a change in the respective companies' Long-Term IDR. In addition, it could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nDomestic Subsidiaries: The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material domestic operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM, BNY Mellon National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware and BNY Mellon Trust Company N.A. The common VR of BK and its material operating subsidiaries reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between the bank and these subsidiaries.\n\nBNYM and other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above its VR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities, relative to holding company senior debt.\n\nIn addition, the intermediate holding company, BNY Mellon IHC, LLC (IHC), is meant to improve the resolvability of BK. Under this structure, the bank's holding company contributed substantial liquidity and capital to IHC, which it will then hold for the benefit of material entities. When assessing the parent's common equity double leverage, an important consideration for notching holding companies under Fitch's criteria, we consider the resources available through the parent company and IHC.\n\nInternational Subsidiaries: The IDRs of BK's material international subsidiaries, namely The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Luxembourg Branch, Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch, and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., are shareholder support driven and are rated in line with BNYM, their intermediate parent, to reflect their role as material operating entities in the BK's mature resolution framework. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the group.\n\nBank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. - Milan Branch's Long-Term IDR is rated above its sovereign, Italy (Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR 'BBB'), but in line with Italy's 'AA' Country Ceiling.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Deposit Ratings: BNYM's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default, given depositor preference in the U.S. Uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V., do not benefit from a rating uplift as they may not benefit from U.S. depositor preference rules unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the U.S. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not receive a rating uplift.\n\nSUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nVRs: The same sensitivities that apply to BK's VR would apply to the subsidiaries' VRs.\n\nIDRs, SSRs and Senior Debt Ratings: The subsidiary ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that could drive a change in BK's VR. The SSRs would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the direct parent's ability and propensity to support its subsidiaries or a change to BK's.\n\nThe ratings of BK's international subsidiaries are also sensitive to factors described in the country risk section of Fitch's \"Bank Rating Criteria\" as it relates to rating banks above the sovereign rating.\n\nDeposit Ratings: Deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in each subsidiaries' IDRs.\n\nVR ADJUSTMENTS\n\nA Business Profile score of 'aa-' was assigned above the implied score of 'a' due to the follow adjustment reasons: Market Position (positive).\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

         "In early 2025, Igor Mazepa's Concorde Capital bought the oil and gas service company Beiken Energy Ukraine, the Ukrainian subsidiary of the Chinese Beiken, for more than $25 million, Forbes reports.\n\nMazepa plans to provide drilling services both in Ukraine and abroad. The acquired company has 8 drilling rigs and plans to receive $10 million EBITDA for 2025. The lifting capacity of the acquired drilling rigs is from 125 to 450 tons.",
         "\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

         "Ukraine: Concorde Capital buys subsidiary of Chinese service company Beiken\n\"These are modern drilling rigs that have ARI certification. If we need more equipment, we will buy more through the Chinese Beiken, we have such an agreement,\" Mazepa noted.\n\nAccording to Mazepa, the company plans to engage exclusively in the oilfield services business and does not intend to enter gas production.\n\nAt the end of January 2025, the founder of the investment group Concorde Capital, Igor Mazepa, as well as his partners Ivan Oleynik and Oleg Medved, withdrew from the hydrocarbon production project at the Mainitskaya site in the Lviv region.\n\nOOO Sela Energy, owned by Igor Mazepa and partners, in January 2021 acquired OOO Navigator Komplekt, owned by Oleg Tokar and partners, for $1.8 million, for using the Mainitskaya area on the basis of special permit No. 4769 until 2036.\n\nSubsequently, a conflict arose between the parties to the agreement: the buyer stated that the gas reserves at the field were less than those declared by the seller, so he asked to amend the purchase and sale agreement in terms of adjusting the value of the corporate rights of the business. The seller, in turn, said that the buyer did not want to finish drilling the field and pay the so-called bonus payment, so he asked the court to recover 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC from the buyer. In May 2024, the parties began to negotiate and finally settled the dispute peacefully out of court.\n\nAccording to YouControl, on 23.01.2025, Sela Energy returned 100% of Navigator Mainitskoye LLC to Navigator Komplekt, and as of 29.01.2025, Oleg Tokar is listed as the ultimate beneficial owner of Navigator Mainitskoye.

It has also been an influential cheerleader for retail investors. It was founded in 1995 and was floated in 2018 at 160p per share. The shares closed down 14½p, or 2.9 per cent, at 482p on Thursday.\n\nAs the\n\nbitcoin price surged past $100,000 \n\n, Summersgill said Bell had no plans to offer crypto services to clients. “Over the long term I wouldn’t say we’ll never offer bitcoin [investments] to our clients, but personally I am not a fan of it. People are conflating investment with gambling.”\n\nThe company disclosed that a legacy problem from more than ten years ago was proving much more costly than expected. It has lifted a provision from less than £800,000 a year ago to £6.2 million to compensate some Sipp (self-invested personal pension) customers put into failed property investments by financial advisers which subsequently went out of business.\n\nA J Bell decided against a special dividend to pay out spare capital, opting for a buyback instead. The final dividend was set at 8.25p, making a 12.5p total for the year up 16 per cent.\n\nIn a positive outlook statement, said Summersgill said: “The long-term structural growth drivers of the market remain strong, as more individuals recognise the importance of taking control of their financial future.”\n\nPensions tax ‘is unworkable’\n\nThe government’s plan to impose inheritance tax on pensions is unworkable in some cases, will be costly and will lead to delays in people receiving legacies, AJ Bell’s chief executive has said.\n\n“It is arguably the most complex and costly way of raising tax from pensions on death,” Michael Summersgill said.\n\nHe criticised Rachel Reeves for announcing the reform without consulting the industry. If she wanted to make inherited pensions subject to tax, it would be easier to impose income tax on the beneficiaries at their highest marginal rate, he said.\n\nSummersgill also pointed out that valuing pension pots for probate purposes would be hugely complicated because of a contradictory reform encouraging pension funds to invest in illiquid hard-to-sell assets like infrastructure and venture capital.\n\nHis criticism in the results on Thursday followed a letter he sent to Reeves on November 22: “If the government presses ahead with the proposals as written, it will risk fundamentally undermining the UK pensions system,” he wrote.\n\nThe chancellor announced in her budget that from April 2027 pension pots would be deemed part of a deceased person’s estate and subjected to inheritance tax when payable. The Treasury has estimated that the reform will raise £640 million in 2027-28, £1.34 billion in 2028-29 and £1.46 billion in 2029-30.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: “Most estates will continue to pay no inheritance tax. The first £325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, rising to £500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants, and £1 million when a tax-free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\n\n“We continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.”",

         "PAXMAN has carried out a directed issue of 1.9 million new shares, raising proceeds of SEK 123.5 million\nAs announced on March 18, 2025, PAXMAN has made an offer to acquire all shares in Dignitana AB (publ) (\"Dignitana\"). The offer is a share offer and any costs related to it are expected to be financed by existing cash, i.e. the Share Issue is done on a stand-alone basis from the acquisition.\n\nPAXMAN intends to use the net proceeds to capitalise on growth opportunities and further strengthen its market position, which includes: - Commercialisation of its latest innovation, a device used to prevent chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. PAXMAN will be completing clinical trials, regulatory testing approvals throughout 2025 with a plan to commercialise Q2 2026. Resources will be required to support a capital roll out in the USA, with further organisational development and marketing to support a successful launch; - investment into PAXMAN's new state of the art facility which will be capable of supporting the growth of the organisation, through improved workflows and additional assembly lines in 2026 and 2027; and - further investments into research and development, specifically topical interventions to support improved efficacy of scalp cooling with new and novel therapies.\n\nDeviation from the shareholders' preferential rights\n\nThe Board of Directors of PAXMAN has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the option of raising capital through an issue of new shares with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors made the assessment that it was more beneficial for the Company and its shareholders to raise additional capital through an issue of new shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, considering that a directed issue (i) further diversifies and strengthens the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors, (ii) can be carried out at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue, (iii) takes less time to implement and entails a lower exposure to potential market volatility than a rights issue, and (iv) enables the Company to act swifty on business opportunities. Furthermore, based on the current market climate, a rights issue would likely have required significant underwriting commitments from an underwriting syndicate, which would have entailed additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting. A rights issue would likely also have needed to be realised at a lower subscription price given the discount levels of rights issues recently realised in the market.\n\nConsidering the above, the Board of Directors' overall assessment was that the reasons for carrying out a directed issue with sufficient strength outweighed the reasons supporting the general rule that share issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders, and that a directed issue was the most favourable alternative for the Company to raise capital.\n\nThe subscription price of SEK 65.0 per new share in the Share Issue was determined through the Bookbuilding conducted by Carnegie. The subscription price represents a premium of approximately 1.9 per cent in relation to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's share during the last ten trading days (SEK 63.8) and a discount of approximately 6.9 per cent in relation to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 20 March 2025 (SEK 69.8). It is therefore the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price in the Share Issue reflected the prevailing market conditions and investor demand, and thus should be considered to be at market terms.\n\nIn consideration of the above, The Board of Directors deems that the Share Issue has been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions as well as the limitations of the issue authorisation as adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024.\n\nShares, share capital and dilution\n\nThe settlement date of the Share Issue is expected to be 25 March 2025 and the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 25 March 2025.\n\nThrough the Share Issue, the total number of shares in PAXMAN will increase by 1,900,000, from 19,012,500 shares to 20,912,500 shares, and the share capital will increase by SEK 1,900,000, from SEK 19,012,500 to SEK to 20,912,500. The Share Issue entails a dilution effect of approximately 9.1 per cent based on the total number of shares and votes in PAXMAN after the Share Issue.\n\nLock-ups\n\nThe Board of Directors and such members of the management who hold shares in the Company have undertaken not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares or other securities in PAXMAN, without the consent of Carnegie, during a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. Additionally, the Company has undertaken not to carry out or propose any additional issuances of shares or other securities in the Company, without the consent of Carnegie, for a period of 180 calendar days following the settlement of the Share Issue. The Company's lock-up undertaking includes an exemption for any consideration shares to be issued in connection with the potential acquisition of Dignitana.\n\nAdvisers\n\nCarnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner in connection with the Share Issue.

After a Financial Times story reported last week that Generali has been in early stage talks with France's Natixis about a potential tie-up, Milano Finanza said the Italian insurer is considering two or three potential targets in the U.S. to solidify its expertise in specific asset classes such as private debt and alternative assets. \"Any such operation would still be relatively small in size and would not preclude discussions with Natixis,\" analyst Andrea Lisi notes.

         "Statehouses are flooded with proposals to regulate private-equity healthcare mergers, as lawmakers begin their 2025 legislative sessions with renewed efforts to check corporate consolidation in the medical sector.\n\nAt least six state legislatures have introduced bills in the past two weeks to curtail—or demand more information about—corporate healthcare mergers, with several of the measures specifically targeting private-equity transactions, according to an analysis of the new proposals by law firm Holland & Knight.",
         "The toughest proposals taking aim at private equity are in Indiana and Connecticut. Oregon and Vermont are considering bills that would limit corporate control of medical practices more broadly. New Mexico and New York are weighing expansions to disclosure requirements for healthcare mergers, but not bans.\n\nNone of these bills are close to being enacted.

McGuire is also concerned about the industry's effect on healthcare quality.\n\n\"We know that when private equity gets involved—and there are plenty of studies—costs go up and patient care declines,\" McGuire said.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Braun, also a Republican, has said he supports using antitrust law to check private equity-led corporate consolidation in the healthcare industry, but his office didn't reply to a request for comment on the bill.\n\nFailed efforts\n\nThe recent surge in state-level healthcare-consolidation proposals may have seemed unlikely just four months ago, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure to allow the state to block medical acquisitions by private-equity or hedge funds. Newsom, a Democrat, said the bill was unnecessary since the state already reviewed healthcare transactions.\n\nThat followed a string of setbacks for similar bills in Oregon, Minnesota and elsewhere, which appeared to suggest these bills had limited political viability.\n\nBut at the end of last year, a Massachusetts measure requiring transparency for medical buyouts, which appeared to have died months earlier, was unexpectedly revived and passed through the legislature. Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, signed it at the beginning of this year.\n\nNow, with the flurry of activity this year, these state-level efforts are showing new life, say healthcare attorneys.\n\nPeter Hanoian, a partner in the private-equity group at law firm Goodwin Procter, said bans on private-equity healthcare deals still appear to be a tough sell politically, while transparency laws look more viable.\n\n\"I think California showed that an outright ban on private equity is not going to catch on across the country,\" he said. \"But there will be more of a focus going forward on transparency.\"\n\nState efforts also dovetail with recent federal initiatives. The Federal Trade Commission last year changed its merger-review laws to investigate more private-equity transactions, and, separately, co-led a probe of private-equity profiteering in healthcare. A bipartisan Senate report last month sharply criticized private equity's role in the sector and questioned whether the industry's profit-centric approach is compatible with quality medicine.\n\nIn response to the federal profiteering probe, private-equity lobby group the American Investment Council said last year the industry is being \"unfairly targeted\" and that the federal agencies were \"overlooking the many ways in which private equity improves competition.\"\n\n\"Private-equity firms' contributions to the healthcare sector provide benefits to and create efficiencies for patients, providers, and employees,\" the group wrote.\n\nThe state proposals—on top of the federal scrutiny—can make it much more challenging and expensive for investors to close healthcare transactions, attorneys say.\n\nIn Connecticut, four bills have been proposed this month to limit private-equity medical acquisitions. They range from one that would prohibit private equity from owning or controlling any medical practice, to one that would expand state power over healthcare investments.\n\nIn Vermont, legislators on Jan. 23 proposed a bill that would increase reporting requirements for healthcare deals and forbid the corporate practice of medicine, changes that could constrain private-equity firms and other financial investors from buying medical practices.\n\nIn Oregon, legislators on Jan. 28 proposed a strict curb on corporate healthcare, which if passed could \"fundamentally change\" ownership models for some of the state's physician's groups, Holland & Knight's report said.\n\nWrite to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com",

         "*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows ",

         "UPDATE 1-Azimut targets March sale of 80% stake in fintech bank to FSI\n*\n\nAims for TNB bank to operate by end of 2025\n\n*\n\nAzimut net profit could reach up to 1.25 billion euros in 2025\n\n(New material in paragraphs 1-7)\n\nBy Alberto Chiumento and Giancarlo Navach\n\nMilan, Jan 16 (Reuters) -\n\nItalian asset manager Azimut aims to sell 80% of its new fintech bank to FSI by the end of March, targeting a market value for the new lender of 1.8-2.2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.3 billion), Chairman Pietro Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nGiuliani told a press conference that the aim was to have the TNB bank up and running by the end of 2025. Azimut launched the project last March, planning to spin off part of its network of financial advisers and convert it into a digital bank, and seeking outside investors for the new business.\n\nIn December, it entered exclusive talks with the domestic private equity fund FSI, which was interested in investing in the new lender.\n\n\"We expect to close with FSI by March, and the goal is to transfer 80% of the new bank to them, while the remaining 20% will remain with Azimut Holding,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe added that rather than obtaining a new banking licence, which is mandatory to execute banking activity in Italy, Azimut plans to buy it from a small bank which already has one.\n\n\"We have a queue of small local banks that would be happy to transfer their banking licence to us. We plan to buy it within this year with the approval of the Bank of Italy,\" Giuliani said during the press conference, adding it might include an exchange of TNB's shares,\n\nHe said a goal for TNB will be a listing on the Milan Bourse, without providing details about the timing.\n\nEarlier in the day, Azimut said in a statement it expects its 2024 net profit to be at the top end of its revised guidance near 600 million euros, and reach up to 1.25 billion euros this year if it gains authorisation for TNB and finalizes the FSI agreement.\n\nWithout it, the net profit target is 400 million euros, it said.\n\nThe company expects 10 billion euros in total net inflows in 2025 after closing 2024 with 18.3 billion euros, beating a target of 14 billion euros.\n\nIt said it will present its five-year business plan this year and will expand into two new countries, one in Africa, the other in Asia.

         "BRITISH Caribbean Insurance Company (BCIC) is poised to finalise its acquisition of JN General Insurance (JNGI) imminently, a move that will significantly reshape Jamaica’s general insurance market. JN has, however, indicated that it is still interested in the insurance market and will set up an insurance agency by mid-year.\n\nThe transaction, which has been in the works for several months, is expected to position the combined entity as a dominant force, accounting for approximately one-third of the market share in Jamaica’s general insurance sector.",

So, at the current time, we don’t really know,” Levy said when asked about the number of JNGI staff he is expecting to take on at BCIC.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the combined entity will create the biggest general insurer in Jamaica.\n\n“The analysis that we’ve done show that while our market share would increase, the overall competitiveness of the industry is not likely to be affected,” Levy said. “Insurance brokers and agents make sure that their customers get the best deals. So I don’t think it will have a negative effect, and there are some benefits from size that our policyholders will derive.”\n\nThe acquisition will consolidate BCIC’s position as one of the leading players in Jamaica’s general insurance market. BCIC and JNGI are both prominent insurers, and their merger will likely enhance operational efficiencies and expand their market reach.\n\nA price has not been disclosed for the acquisition. JNGI, however, had $10.95-billion worth of assets at the end of 2023. In that year, it recorded a loss of $527 million.\n\nBut the JN Group divesting its insurance company is not likely to be the end of the entity’s participation in the insurance market.\n\n“JN is also actively pursuing the establishment of an insurance agency, which should be operational in six months,” Jarrett added in his note to staff, telling them that more details will be shared on the development in the coming weeks.\n\nJN Financial Group, the parent company of JNGI, initiated the sale as part of a broader strategy to divest non-core assets and bolster its capital base. The decision was partly driven by financial pressures stemming from losses incurred by its UK-based subsidiary, JN Bank (UK). The bank that was set up in 2020 to help JN Financial Group navigate the continued loss of correspondent banking relationships critical for its operations overseas was divested last year to Step One Money UK, a specialist consumer lending business. That deal raised £20 million Tier 1 (core) capital for JN Financial Group.\n\nJN Financial Group is also looking to divest a portion of its wealth management arm, JN Fund Managers. People familiar with the deal tell BusinessWeek that JN Fund Managers is now evaluating bids received with assistance from an advisory firm to ensure favourable outcomes for the JN Group.\n\nThe divestments are part of an ongoing transformation the organisation is undergoing that was initiated by its board of directors and approved by regulators.\n\nBusinessWeek understands the transformation could affect the number of branches and automated banking machines (ABMs) operated by the JN Financial Group in the coming months.\n\nThe people who spoke to BusinessWeek said the move is part of JN Bank’s push to manage its costs, and it has been reviewing the performance of its branches, ABMs, and staff. JN operates about 144 ABMs across Jamaica and close to 20 branches.\n\n“The divestment of subsidiaries could have an impact on staff and the functions of the group. It is to be seen how the changes will manifest at the group level,” the people said.\n\nThe company is also looking to raise about $10 billion on the bond market before the end of this quarter to help boost its capital base, a requirement from its regulator, the Bank of Jamaica. The group has about $311 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nJN Financial Group is expected to complete the divestment of its JN General Insurance Company in the next few days and is poised to set up an insurance agency to continue in the business. The company is also set to close branches and ABMs and cut staff as part of a general reorganisation.",

         "0925 GMT - Reports that Assicurazioni Generali is exploring opportunities in asset management confirm its strong focus on growing its asset and wealth management division, Equita says in a research note. After a Financial Times story reported last week that Generali has been in early stage talks with France's Natixis about a potential tie-up, Milano Finanza said the Italian insurer is considering two or three potential targets in the U.S. to solidify its expertise in specific asset classes such as private debt and alternative assets. \"Any such operation would still be relatively small in size and would not preclude discussions with Natixis,\" analyst Andrea Lisi notes. Shares in Generali, which is set to outline its new plan late January, have gained almost 48% since the start of the year. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)",
         "0903 GMT - Holcim's plan to have its North American business listed both in North America and in Europe does away with the need for Europe-only investors to have to sell their shares in the soon-to-be spun-off business, RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling says in a research note. Approval of the plan is now set up for May 14 through an ordinary simple majority vote during its annual general meeting, Codling says. Holcim shares trade 1.5% down at 90.10 Swiss francs.(pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)\n\n0737 GMT - Holcim confirming its plan to dual list its North American business is a positive development, and it removes a potential share overhang, Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider says in a research note. Doing so will also allow shareholders to continue to cash in on the expected strong growth of U.S. infrastructure, the analyst says. \"That the shareholder approval is now planned to be obtained at the AGM--close to the spinoff date--signals high confidence and reflects positive shareholder responses,\" the analyst says. (pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)\n\n0650 GMT - The global battery sector will likely see stronger demand next year, HSBC Global Research analysts write in a note. Chinese domestic battery makers reported higher utilization rate for 2H24, due to limited capacity additions in the last two years, they add. Strong growth in the EV sector and robust demand for energy storage system batteries provide support for the overall outlook, they say. HSBC expects the lithium-ion battery industry's utilization rate to recover to 57% next year from 52% this year. In addition, capacity expansion overseas will also accelerate on concerns of potential U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese battery imports, they add.

         "Correction to Holcim Market Talk Article\n0903 GMT - Holcim's plan to have its North American business listed both in North America and in Europe does away with the need for Europe-only investors to have to sell their shares in the soon-to-be spun-off business, RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling says in a research note. Approval of the plan is now set up for May 14 through an ordinary simple majority vote during its annual general meeting, Codling says. Holcim shares trade 1.5% down at 90.10 Swiss francs.(pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)\n\n0737 GMT - Holcim confirming its plan to dual list its North American business is a positive development, and it removes a potential share overhang, Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider says in a research note. Doing so will also allow shareholders to continue to cash in on the expected strong growth of U.S. infrastructure, the analyst says. \"That the shareholder approval is now planned to be obtained at the AGM--close to the spinoff date--signals high confidence and reflects positive shareholder responses,\" the analyst says. (pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)\n\n0650 GMT - The global battery sector will likely see stronger demand next year, HSBC Global Research analysts write in a note. Chinese domestic battery makers reported higher utilization rate for 2H24, due to limited capacity additions in the last two years, they add. Strong growth in the EV sector and robust demand for energy storage system batteries provide support for the overall outlook, they say. HSBC expects the lithium-ion battery industry's utilization rate to recover to 57% next year from 52% this year. In addition, capacity expansion overseas will also accelerate on concerns of potential U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese battery imports, they add. The brokerage maintains a buy rating for Lead Intelligence and Yinghe Technology.

The RemainCo will be resilient and less prone to\nrecessionary headwinds and economic shocks, considering it exhibits\nfavorable characteristics such as less cash flow volatility, stable\nlow-to-mid single-digit growth rates, and higher profit margins.\n\nThe lottery industry is also less exposed to competitive threats,\nbenefitting from significant barriers to entry due to high\nregulatory oversight and capital intensity. It enjoys strong\ntailwinds from iLottery adoption, considering it appears to expand\nthe player base (including the ability to reach younger\ngenerations). The industry has exhibited positive spend-per-capita\ntrends even during periods of dislocation, despite meaningful\ncasino development over the last 20 years, including in states that\nhave legalized traditional casino gaming.\n\nIndustry Leader: IGT is a market leader in lottery technology and\nservices, primarily earning revenue from draw games and instant\ntickets, and it competes with Scientific Games and Intralot. It\ncontracts with around 40 U.S. jurisdictions, including Texas, New\nYork, California, Florida and New Jersey, and holds a strong market\nposition in Italy. IGT typically retains contract renewals through\nstrong performance and value-added services. Recently, it secured\nlong-term extensions in Tennessee and Germany, and it won a new\ncontract in Luxembourg.\n\nConsiderable Cash Demands: Fitch expects FCF to be negative in\n2025-2026 after upfront license renewal fees, due to the upcoming\nmaturity of the at least EUR1 billion Italian Lotto contract,\nfollowed by key renewals in New York and Texas. However, the\nrenewals are smaller and do not require lump-sum payments. In\naddition, Fitch assumes a significant portion of remaining sale\nproceeds to be directed to shareholder returns, which Fitch\nincludes in assessing FCF. IGT will subsequently revert to solid\nFCF margins in the high single digit to low double-digit range once\nthe heavy capex cycle subsides.\n\nRecurring Revenues: About 95% of the standalone lottery business\nrevenue will be recurring in nature, up from 80% pre-transaction,\nproviding predictable and sustainable cash flows. Relationships\ntend to be governed by long-term contracts and will continue to be\ndiversified across business models, products, and customers. The\ntermination of, or failure to renew or extend, its contracts, which\nare awarded through competitive procurement processes, could place\nthe company at a competitive disadvantage. However, the lottery\nbusiness has successfully converted 90% of its top 10 incumbent\ncontract re-bids.\n\nParent Subsidiary Linkage: Fitch applies the strong subsidiary/weak\nparent approach under its Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating\nCriteria. Fitch views the linkage as strong across IGT's entities\ngiven the openness of access and control by the parent and relative\nease of cash movement throughout the structure. Fitch views the\nentities on a consolidated basis, and the ratings are linked.\n\nPeer Analysis\n\nIGT is stronger than its lottery peers Scientific Games Holdings LP\n(B/Stable); Intralot S.A. (CCC+); and Allwyn International a.s.\n(BB-/Positive). Scientific Games has meaningfully higher leverage\n(in the 7.0x-8.0x range), while Intralot has a complex capital\nstructure with the potential for high refinancing risk that limits\nits access to international debt capital markets. Allwyn has a\nstronger business profile with an improvement in its scale as well\nas its business and product diversification following the start of\nits UK National Lottery contract in 2024, with EBITDAR leverage\nexpected to temper to 3.7x by 2027.\n\nIGT has a similar credit profile to slot supplier, Light & Wonder\nInc. (LNW; BB/Stable), despite slightly higher leverage from\nlottery exposure, which can withstand higher leverage as the\nlottery business tends to be resilient to recessionary headwinds.\nAristocrat Leisure Limited (ALL; BBB-/Positive) has a stronger\nbusiness profile as a global gaming supplier and low leverage. ALL\nhas also made an accelerated and concerted push into the online\nreal money gaming space, while maintaining its leading position in\nsocial casino and casual gaming genres. Everi Holdings Inc. (EVRI;\nBB-/RWP) is rated lower due to the slot supplier and cash services\nprovider's smaller size and integration risks of newly-acquired\ncompanies.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\n- Transaction closes in 3Q25;\n\n- Lottery sales over the forecast period improve modestly in the\nlow single-digit range primarily helped by a price increase in the\ninstant ticket category, new product sales and recovery in the U.S.\nmulti-state jackpot activity;\n\n- 2025 EBITDA margin contracts around 300bps for the RemainCo, due\nto increased investment in the business (contract re-bids and\nextensions, cloud-based solutions, and network optimization) and an\nunfavorable impact due to product sale mix. Thereafter, margin\nexpands slowly and approaches 46% over its forecast period due to\nrecent initiatives to right-size the organization and potentially\nadditional cost saving initiatives;\n\n- Capital commitments remain elevated over the next two years due\nto a potentially successful re-bid of the over EUR1 billion Italian\nLotto contract (matures November 2025), and key renewals/extensions\nin New York, Texas and California (all due 2026), resulting in\nnegative FCF margin. Thereafter, the margin reverts to high single\ndigits as the capex heavy cycle cools in the $200-$250 million\nannual range;\n\n- Gross debt declines by about $1.6 billion in 2025 based on the\ncommitted debt repayment of $2 billion at close of the divestiture\nin 3Q25, partially offset by the new up to EUR1 billion term loan\nsplit across two tranches at the IGTSPA level, which will in part\nbe used to repay the outstanding revolver balance, with the\nremainder applied to Lotto contract's upfront fee payment. Fitch\nassumes notes with ensuing maturities will be refinanced as they\ncome due;\n\n- Fitch assumes capital allocation from the remaining sale proceeds\nto be largely directed towards shareholder returns over a period of\nseveral months;\n\n- Base interest rates assumptions reflect the current SOFR curve.\n\nRecovery Analysis\n\nFitch applies the generic approach for issuers in the 'BB' rating\ncategory and equalizes the IDR and unsecured debt instrument\nratings when average recovery prospects are present, as per the\nCorporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria.\nIssuers rated 'BB-' and above are too far from default for a\ncredible default scenario analysis to be generated, and they would\nlikely generate Recovery Ratings that are too high across all\ninstruments. Where an RR is assigned, the generic approach reflects\nthe relative instrument rankings and their recoveries, as well as\nthe higher EV of 'BB' ratings in a generic sense for the most\nsenior instruments.\n\nConsidering the IDR of 'BB+', the Category 2 first lien senior\nsecured debt is notched one level to 'BBB-'/'RR2'. The 'RR2' for\nIGT's secured debt reflects its designation as a Category 2 first\nlien under the Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings\nCriteria as Fitch applies caps in a number of jurisdictions, given\nthe instruments are issued by non-US based borrowers and material\ncash flows and assets will continue to be generated outside of the\nU.S. for the standalone lottery segment (39% in Italy, 13% Rest of\nWorld, and the remaining 48% in U.S. and Canada).\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative\nRating Action/Downgrade\n\n- EBITDA leverage sustaining above 4.0x;\n\n- The loss of material lottery contracts, meaningful market share\nerosion, or a weakening of underlying lottery fundamentals;\n\n- Meaningful, debt-funded upfront payments for lottery concessions,\nwith higher than expected contract values, if not coupled with a\ncredible de-levering strategy;\n\n- The slots business suffering from market share loss or\ndeterioration of operating fundamentals.\n\nIf the secured notes and term loan are rated investment-grade by\ncertain combinations of rating agencies, the collateral would fall\naway. If this occurs, Fitch would rate the secured debt on par with\nthe IDR and would not apply any upward notching.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive\nRating Action/Upgrade\n\n- EBITDA leverage declining below 3.5x;\n\n- Stable or growing slot share, particularly in North America;\n\n- New adjacencies (i.e. iLottery and Digital) achieving meaningful\nscale faster-than-anticipated.\n\nLiquidity and Debt Structure\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2024, IGT had $584 million in unrestricted cash and\n$1.4 billion in additional borrowing capacity under its partially\ndrawn revolving facilities, which mature in July 2027. In\ncomparison, scheduled annual debt repayments are EUR200 million for\nthe company's term loans maturing in January 2027.\n\nIGT has committed to repay $2 billion of its existing debt from the\n$4.05 billion gross sale proceeds, and Fitch expects management to\nprioritize the existing EUR term loans and senior secured notes\nwith upcoming maturities. A significant portion of the remaining\nproceeds will be returned to shareholders. IGT's capital structure\nis fully secured and has a well-laddered debt maturity wall spread\nacross 2026 to 2030. IGT should have sufficient liquidity in the\nnear term to cover all required instalment payments associated with\nits Lotto contract re-bid.\n\nFCF margin will turn sharply negative in 2025 and 2026 due to a\nheavy capex schedule focused on Italian and U.S. contract renewals,\nbefore turning positive in 2027. Fitch estimates the RemainCo will\nstill have sufficient cash and availability under its new revolver\nafter being downsized by about 20% to fund capex requirements for\nthe lottery re-bids.\n\nIssuer Profile\n\nIGT is a leader in gaming across the lottery, gaming machines, and\ndigital channels and provides an integrated portfolio of gaming\ntechnology products and services. It is the world's largest lottery\noperator and a top three slots supplier.\n\nMACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND SECTOR FORECASTS\n\nFitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector\nForecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in its\ncredit analysis. Fitch's macroeconomic forecasts, commodity price\nassumptions, default rate forecasts, sector key performance\nindicators and sector-level forecasts are among the data items\nincluded.\n\nESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless\notherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG\nissues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on\nthe entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are\nbeing managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not\ninputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the\nrelevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.\n\n   Entity/Debt              Rating           Recovery   Prior\n   -----------              ------           --------   ----- \nInternational Game \nTechnology plc        LT IDR BB+  Affirmed              BB+ \n\n   senior secured     LT     BBB- Affirmed     RR2      BBB- \n\nIGT Lottery \nHoldings B.V.

The third option, going public, is the only way left to sell the bank, especially at a time when banks are doing well. Typically, private equity funds in these cases sell a stake on the stock exchange and immediately distribute the money to the fund's investors, with a good return on the initial investment [the 30% sale on the stock exchange should exceed the amount invested by the 75%, which was one billion euros]. Then Lone Star has to sell the rest of the bank, but it has to respect the lock-up period after the stock market sale. It can't sell the rest of the shares straight away. At that point it can sell to another private equity fund or to institutional investors,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, João Pedro Oliveira e Costa, BPI's CEO, when asked about a possible takeover of Novobanco by the shareholder of the bank he runs, CaixaBank, said that \"in the future the battle in the market will be fought on a larger scale and the size we have is not enough\".\n\nIn his presentation of the accounts, Pedro Castro e Almeida, CEO of Santander Totta, said that an IPO (Initial Public Offering) is always done \"at a discount\" and synergies of scale can only be achieved through mergers and acquisitions. This was in relation to the scenarios on the table for the future of Novobanco.\n\nPaulo Macedo, CGD's CEO, who has already admitted that he is studying the purchase of Novobanco, said at the results presentation that for those studying the operation, Novobanco's Initial Public Offering \"is not an impediment to anything\". In other words, CGD could go ahead with the purchase of Novobanco despite the 30% IPO announced by CEO Mark Bourke.\n\n\"I don't think Lone Star will take Novobanco to the stock exchange if it doesn't have a final destination for a last buyer,\" said Caixa's CEO.\n\nIncreasing market share organically is a challenge. Especially when competition in financial services is increasing, including from players outside the traditional banking system.\n\nOn the other hand, if you look at the Portuguese banks that have presented their accounts for 2024, they all show a rise in costs, partly due to inflation and salary increases. The efficiency ratio is stagnating, which helps legitimize merger scenarios.\n\nAlso supporting merger scenarios in banking are the conclusions of the Draghi Report on the competitiveness of the European Union, which warns of the low size of companies (including banks) when compared to those in the US and China.\n\nRecord profits that won't be repeated this year or next\n\nIf the seven largest banks achieved record profits in 2024, exceeding 5.5 billion euros and double-digit returns, that eldorado will not be repeated. Not least because these profits were helped by the release of impairments. \"The banks' results, especially those of our competitors, have a large loan recovery component, i.e. the release of provisions made in the past,\" said BPI's CEO in an interview with Observador.\n\nBecause of the fall in interest rates, this will be the year in which the banks' recurring profits will be lower and so the increase in turnover will have to compensate for the reduction in net interest income. How to compensate for the fall in net interest income is what the banks will have to answer.\n\nBanks have strong capital and liquidity positions. The quality of their assets remains resilient overall, and their profitability has reached the highest levels since the start of European banking supervision by the ECB, mainly due to higher interest rates.\n\nDespite the robust balance sheets and risk profiles of credit institutions, caution is required due to persistently high geopolitical tensions and the associated uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nEuropean banks have so far managed to withstand recent geopolitical shocks and the resulting rise in inflation, supported, among other things, by the broad resilience of the real economy, but it is crucial that banks remain vigilant and regularly assess the implications that such events may have for their business, their operations and their risk profile.\n\nTechnological advances are also seen as a priority for the future of the banking sector, considering that it is essential for banks to step up digitization efforts and ensure prudent management of the risks arising from the adoption of new technologies. The future business model of banking is already beginning to take shape. Banking is moving forward with Artificial Intelligence and is moving towards becoming \"subscription banking\", personalized services (a sort of Netflix of financial services). Finally, it will also be the year of the distribution of dividends to shareholders.\n\nEU financial regulation versus that of the United States is another topic that will take center stage in 2025. There will be a debate about whether Europe should maintain stricter rules than the US in the name of competitiveness.",

Its U.S. shale division, which is worth around $20 billion, its $10 billion lubricants division, and its marketing and retail business, valued at up to $40 billion, are potential target areas, the analyst write. BP's shares closed Friday at 433.25 pence and are down 9.45% over the past 12 months. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nFebruary 10, 2025 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT)",

         "Sabadell asks CNMC to probe asset sales in its final test\nSabadell has asked the CNMC to include in the market test it will launch in the next few days not only competing banks, but also customers and, in particular, SMEs, which are the most likely to suffer from the disappearance of an operator. He should do so in order, he says, to ask them if they see the need to impose structural remedies on BBVA, including the divestment of part of Sabadell's business to facilitate the presence of a fourth operator to exert competitive pressure.

It would be from their point of view the only way to know their opinion.\n\nThe remedies proposed by BBVA, such as closing only branches that overlap within a radius of less than 300 meters or guaranteeing for a time the conditions of SME customers, are behavioral and temporary, which in Sabadell's opinion does not guarantee the emergence of a fourth competitor.\n\nSMEs is a business with high barriers to entry, reminds the CNMC, and the fourth entity would be far behind the third in several autonomous communities.\n\nNeither fintechs nor foreign entities would be able to fill the gap. Neobanks tend to focus on individuals, and foreign entities work with large companies. In addition to this, there are some precedents that show the difficulty to break through, such as ING's exit from the SME business in 2019.\n\nThey intend to be asked about forcing BBVA to divest its SME business.The problem in the Spanish market is that regional entities such as Abanca or Cajamar fail to exert competitive pressure beyond their place of origin. In Banc Sabadell's opinion, this means that competition could be severely damaged in at least five autonomous communities: Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Galicia and Murcia. In Catalonia, three banks would have between 80% and 85% of the market.\n\nIt is expected that the CNMC will decide to accept the remedies presented by BBVA, tightening the application period. The bank is confident that the Competition procedure will not cause too much wear and tear. On the other hand, there are precedents in Europe of competition analyses that have resulted in divestments. In the integration of ABN Amro and Fortis, Brussels forced the sale of the SME business. The Italian authorities forced Intesa Sanpaolo and UBI Banca to sell 500 branches.",

PZU and Pekao have signed a letter of intent to sell their shares in Alior Bank to Bank Pekao.\n\n\"It is very unusual for an entity like ours to be a shareholder in two banks at the same time. We try to solve this problem in such a way that it generates value for the companies, while at the same time we do not close ourselves off to different options. There is a lot of movement in the market, changes in interest rates are possible, which is why we have not chosen the most far-reaching option, i.e., for example, the sale of one of these banks outside the group or a merger of the two banks,\" Artur Olech said.\n\n\"We are taking the time to develop the banks, to build the concept. The management boards of both banks are new, they need to get to know their institutions better. Our decision is rational,\" he assessed.\n\nAccording to PZU representatives, the planned acquisition of Alior Bank shares by Pekao is advantageous from Pekao's point of view.\n\n\"Pekao has an opportunity to acquire an entity that is ideal from the point of view of the implementation of the M&A strategy, very complementary to Bank Pekao compared to other universal banks. This is a time of consolidation and there is justification for this transaction,\" said the CEO of PZU Zycie (PZU's life insurances unit) Jaroslaw Mastalerz.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be settled in cash. At Monday's closing price of Alior Bank (PLN 92.34, EUR 21.52), the bank's stake in PZU's hands is worth more than PLN 3.8 billion (EUR 885.4 mln).\n\nWhen asked about the valuation of the Alior Bank stake, CEO Artur Olech said: \"The valuation of the transaction for the sale of Alior shares to Bank Pekao will take place on an annual basis (2024). It will be a market price, a fair price, but - I hope - taking into account the potential and development of Alior Bank.\"\n\n\"By selling shares in Alior Bank to Bank Pekao, we will directly continue to control Bank Pekao to the same extent and we are interested in increasing the value of Alior Bank not only at the time of the transaction, but also in the future, under Bank Pekao. We do not have an assumed level of premium or discount to the market price. We assume market value,\" the CEO added.\n\nAccording to PZU representatives, the company will not recognise the profit from the transaction at the consolidated level due to the company's stake in Pekao, but at the individual level. At current valuations, PZU estimates it at over PLN 1 billion (EUR 233 mln).\n\nPZU said that the freed capital could be used for the group's business development and transformation of the economy. The investment directions listed are: development of strategic partnerships in Poland and abroad, including distribution, bancassurance and embedded insurance; development of the health area; participation in financing the transformation of the Polish economy.\n\n\"We have no problem with remaining partly and in a different manner in the Polish banking sector with the amount of capital we have in Alior,\" said the CEO of PZU Zycie Jaroslaw Mastalerz.\n\n\"So, we are open to investing some of this capital in Polish banks, but not as a shareholder, but through investments in AT1, T2 bonds, in a diversified way. We have a chance to get no worse returns than exposure to Alior Bank. We have no appetite to increase our exposure to banking,\" he added.\n\nThe PZU Group has a 31.91 percent stake of Alior Bank. In Bank Pekao, PZU's shareholding is 20 percent. As stated, PZU does not want to increase its stake in Pekao.\n\nBank Pekao is the second largest universal bank in Poland with PLN 324 billion (EUR 75.5 bln) in assets and a 10 percent market share. Alior Bank had PLN 91 billion (EUR 21.2 bln) in assets and a 3 percent market share at the end of September.\n\nPZU'S STRATEGY PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHERS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION\n\nIn international markets, the PZU group - already present in five CEE countries - wants to grow by testing a 'light' model of expansion through partner distribution channels and reinsurance.\n\n\"We are thinking about expansion in Europe, as the EU gives us the opportunity to operate through 'freedom of service' in many markets. We would like to be where competently we could offer good solutions,\" PZU's CEO Artur Olech said.\n\n\"These are mainly markets with high premiums, moving towards digital transformation and with good access to data. Polish insurers, including PZU, are, against the European background, one of the most agile in customer relations and good at analysing and creating products based on data. We can start operating in selected Western European countries. We do not need to limit ourselves to CEE markets,\" he added.\n\nThe CEO reported that PZU wants to first enter into strategic partnerships through 'freedom of service' vehicles, and then search for potential acquisitions.\n\n\"As a first move, we want to enter into strategic partnerships with our balance sheet, product through ‘freedom of service’ vehicles. Once we know the market, there may be acquisition opportunities to have cost synergies,\" Olech said.\n\n\"However, there is no reason today to look for growth outside Poland by force, when there are still many opportunities here. You have to export what you do well,\" he stressed.\n\nAs CEO Olech said, the company's plans mainly concern non-life insurance, motor insurance, so-called embedded products or bancassurance.\n\n\"You can also operate in 'freedom of service' models using our reinsurance programmes,\" he pointed out.\n\nIn its new strategy PZU has assumed PLN 500 million (EUR 116.5 mln) of additional revenue from active reinsurance outside the group by 2030.\n\n\"We do not rule out acquisitions if opportunities arise, but our strategic plan is mainly based on looking for elements of growth in Poland in lines where we are not yet so strong: health, bancassurance, embedded products,\" CEO Olech said.\n\nThe group wants to invest further in the health area. Among other things, it wants to increase the use of its own outlets (with a target share of around 60 percent) and improve the terms of cooperation with partner outlets.\n\n\"We want to equip PZU Zdrowie [PZU Health - MI ed.] with PLN 1 billion to invest in medical infrastructure and build a strong competence centre,\" CEO Artur Olech said.\n\n\"We were able to build up the results of this segment in a relatively short time. The infrastructure did not grow, we give a lot of margin to sub-suppliers. It will still go to them 40 percent, but given the size of this market, we want to handle more directly. PZU Zycie needs to 'grab' that margin, because it's a very competitive market,\" CEO of PZU Zycie Jaroslaw Mastalerz said.\n\n\"Investors see the valuation of the PZU group as a non-life insurer, life insurer and banks. Meanwhile, an entity will emerge that will have a similar value to the TOP3 medical operators. We want to show investors where profit is created,\" he added.\n\nPZU's strategy assumes an increase in net profit to over PLN 6.2 billion (EUR 1.44 bln) by 2027, achieving ROE from core business of over 19 percent.\n\nAmong other things, the group plans to focus on core business with the goal of significant value growth, including an increase in gross insurance revenue to PLN 36.2 billion (EUR 8.43 bln), over 40 percent growth in EPS from core business and over 20 percent operating margin in life insurance.\n\npel/ ao/ han/",

         "Holding in ICICI Prudential Asset Management estimated to be worth $5 billion\n\nPrudential is considering a listing of part of its stake in an Indian asset management joint venture.",
         "The FTSE 100 asset manager has told investors it is evaluating a partial exit from its 49 per cent stake in ICICI Prudential Asset Management and would return net proceeds to investors. The stake is estimated to be worth $5 billion.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said the total joint venture holding would beworth about a quarter of Prudential’s total market value if compared with peers such as HDFC Asset Management, an Indian asset manager with a market valuation of around $9.1 billion.\n\nPrudential did not disclose the size of the holding it would seek to offload or the venues it was considering for the transaction. The group has dual primary listings in London and Hong Kong.\n\nPrudential’s share price closed up 39½p, or 5.8 per cent, at 722p on Wednesday, following the announcement.\n\nBank of America analysts said any divestment “could be a positive catalyst” for Prudential’s share price, as the funds would be redistributed to investors and boost the group’s earnings per share, adding: “This is clearly only a high-level indication of value and any listing process could incur costs and lead to a discount.”\n\nPrudential, founded in London in 1848, once dominated the British industry but has refocused its operations on the fast-growing economies of Asia and Africa. Anil Wadhwani, the chief executive, is based in Hong Kong alongside other top executives and the group held its annual general meeting in the former British colony for the first time last year.\n\nThe London market has\n\nfaced a dearth of public listings\n\nin recent years amid economic uncertainty and a persistent gap in the valuation estimates between potential investors and the asset-owners looking to exit companies.\n\nBrian Hanratty, head of equity capital markets at the investment bank Peel Hunt, said the UK market had experienced a “quiet start” to the year, as possible issuers finalised full-year accounts before considering any corporate activity.

         "Prudential considers listing stake in Indian joint venture\nThe FTSE 100 asset manager has told investors it is evaluating a partial exit from its 49 per cent stake in ICICI Prudential Asset Management and would return net proceeds to investors. The stake is estimated to be worth $5 billion.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said the total joint venture holding would beworth about a quarter of Prudential’s total market value if compared with peers such as HDFC Asset Management, an Indian asset manager with a market valuation of around $9.1 billion.\n\nPrudential did not disclose the size of the holding it would seek to offload or the venues it was considering for the transaction. The group has dual primary listings in London and Hong Kong.\n\nPrudential’s share price closed up 39½p, or 5.8 per cent, at 722p on Wednesday, following the announcement.\n\nBank of America analysts said any divestment “could be a positive catalyst” for Prudential’s share price, as the funds would be redistributed to investors and boost the group’s earnings per share, adding: “This is clearly only a high-level indication of value and any listing process could incur costs and lead to a discount.”\n\nPrudential, founded in London in 1848, once dominated the British industry but has refocused its operations on the fast-growing economies of Asia and Africa. Anil Wadhwani, the chief executive, is based in Hong Kong alongside other top executives and the group held its annual general meeting in the former British colony for the first time last year.\n\nThe London market has\n\nfaced a dearth of public listings\n\nin recent years amid economic uncertainty and a persistent gap in the valuation estimates between potential investors and the asset-owners looking to exit companies.\n\nBrian Hanratty, head of equity capital markets at the investment bank Peel Hunt, said the UK market had experienced a “quiet start” to the year, as possible issuers finalised full-year accounts before considering any corporate activity. Yet, he said, the “broader backdrop remains generally constructive” for companies looking to list on the London Stock Exchange.\n\n“We’re expecting activity to pick up in the second quarter and are aware of a number of issuers monitoring that window — that will likely be the first real test for the UK market this year. It has so far been a European-led reopening of the IPO market,” he said.\n\n“The year started with a generally positive outlook for the UK macroeconomic environment and equity markets — although the bond yield spikes caused a wobble of confidence.”\n\nPrudential reiterated its commitment to India as a jurisdiction and said it would provide a further update on its plans “at an appropriate time”.\n\nIn a statement, the group said: “India is a strategically important market for Prudential with compelling growth prospects. We will continue to explore opportunities to grow our business in the market.”\n\nPrudential’s plan to return more funding to shareholders comes as it continues with a share buyback programme worth £1.6 billion. The Asia-focused life insurance giant reported a 10 per cent increase in new business profits to about $2.3 billion in the nine months to the end of September 2024.",

The engine manufacturer's inability to meet its timely maintenance obligations has impacted the operational capabilities of airBaltic's Airbus A220-300 fleet, forcing the airline to adjust its summer schedule.\n\nAfter this announcement, Briskens said on X that the Transport Ministry has instructed the supervisory board of national airline airBaltic to promptly explain the airline's decision to cancel a number of flights and its impact on Latvia's connectivity.\n\nThe minister emphasizes that it is absolutely unacceptable that the company's management has not publicly explained its decisions.\n\nAt the same time, Briskens reminds that the management of airBaltic - including the company's CEO Martin Gauss and chairman of the supervisory board Klavs Vasks - must keep their promises to raise EUR 300 million to implement the company's business plan and to ensure that airBaltic's activities are in the interests of the state of Latvia and passengers.\n\nIt has also been reported that the share capital of airBaltic will be reduced by EUR 571.293 million in preparation for an initial public offering (IPO), the government decided at a closed cabinet sitting on August 30, 2024.\n\nThe terms of the share capital reduction state that airBaltic's current share capital is EUR 596.473 million, which means that after the planned reduction it will be EUR 25.179 million.\n\nThe company's share capital currently consists of 25,647,282 Class A shares with a nominal value of EUR 10 each, 74,323,152 Class B shares with a nominal value of EUR 3 each, 113,164,518 Class C shares with a nominal value of EUR 1 each, and 38,660,300 Class D shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.1.\n\nAs it prepares for the IPO, airBaltic has decided to simplify its share structure. As a result, the nominal value of all Class A, B and C shares will be reduced to EUR 0.1 and EUR 571.293 million will be allocated to to offset accumulated losses from previous years. Shareholders will not be paid any remuneration or compensation in connection with the reduction in the nominal value of these shares.\n\nThus, the share capital of airBaltic after the reduction will be EUR 25.179 million, consisting of 251,795,252 dematerialized shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.1 per share. Each share will entitle the holder to one vote at the company's shareholders' meeting, a dividend and a liquidation allowance.\n\nTransport Minister Kaspars Briskens (Progressives) said earlier that the talks with airBaltics' strategic investor are not being held to sell a controlling stake but that the plan is to sell a minority stake in preparation for the IPO.\n\nBloomberg news agency reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that German national airline Lufthansa is considering taking a stake in airBaltic ahead of the Latvian state-owned carrier's proposed IPO.\n\nBriskens has not yet officially disclosed whether the potential strategic investor is Lufthansa, as well as how many shares in airBaltic could be sold to the investor and for how much. \"Work is ongoing. There must be a mutual agreement to disclose such information. As soon as the transaction documents are finalized, both sides will immediately comment on it,\" the minister said earlier.\n\nAt the same time, Briskens stressed that the responsibility for the capital increase lies with airBaltic CEO Martin Gauss and Vasks. \"The performance of the company's management will be evaluated on the basis of the results achieved,\" the transport minister said.",

Scotiabank's Ben Isaacson says that classifying lumber as a national security issue is the first that will be solved by laxer regulations, opening up federal land to harvest, as well as potential surgical tariffs on the industry. Isaacson says this has the potential to 'stack' on the looming 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. \"If all of these taxes move forward, it's hard to see how parts of the Canadian Paper & Forestry Products sector aren't ravaged,\" he says.

The U.K. spirits maker has been able to outperform the U.S. spirits market, thanks to innovation and its Tequila portfolio, they say. However, demand for spirits in the U.S., a key market for beverage makers, remains soft, DB says. This is largely driven by a prolonged period of normalization after the boom during the pandemic. The industry is unlikely to return to prior rates of growth once the normalization is complete, due to structural factors including lower alcohol consumption, the analysts say.

Global uncertainties, particularly around the recovery path of the Chinese market, are likely to result in another difficult year for the watch industry, she says.

         "Analysts said New York-based Elliott Investment Management would probably lobby for significant changes at BP, which could include selling off renewable energy assets, doubling down on oil and gas, and a push for a new chairman.\n\nWells Fargo analysts also raised the prospect of a full break-up of the British oil major, which it said could unlock billions of pounds in value for investors. The bank said BP could split drilling and exploration assets, refining business, oil trading arm and other operations, such as its renewable energy assets.\n\nA splintering would draw significant political attention given BP's importance to Britain's economy. It has 16,000 British staff and it is the country's fifth-largest publicly listed company.\n\nBP shares surged more than 7pc yesterday after it emerged over the weekend that Elliott had built a stake in the company. Elliott has declined to comment on the size of its stake or its intentions but Bloomberg, which first reported the investment, said the hedge fund was preparing to push for \"transformative measures\".\n\nRoger Read at Wells Fargo said Elliott was most likely preparing a letter to shareholders outlining its criticism and its suggested remedies.\n\nThe analysts wrote: \"Based on our experience with Elliott taking activist positions within our coverage universe, the letter would be the next big thing.\n\n\"In the letter, we would expect Elliott to illustrate both BP's alleged shortcomings and a clear path to increase value (likely through some combination of reorganisation/cost reductions, divestment(s), significant debt reduction).\n\n\"Following those efforts, Elliott would likely expect BP to return significant cash to shareholders.\" Elliott, founded in 1977 by billionaire Paul Singer, currently controls $70bn (£56bn) of assets.

         "Activist hedge fund fuels BP break-up pressure\nAnalysts said New York-based Elliott Investment Management would probably lobby for significant changes at BP, which could include selling off renewable energy assets, doubling down on oil and gas, and a push for a new chairman.\n\nWells Fargo analysts also raised the prospect of a full break-up of the British oil major, which it said could unlock billions of pounds in value for investors. The bank said BP could split drilling and exploration assets, refining business, oil trading arm and other operations, such as its renewable energy assets.\n\nA splintering would draw significant political attention given BP's importance to Britain's economy. It has 16,000 British staff and it is the country's fifth-largest publicly listed company.\n\nBP shares surged more than 7pc yesterday after it emerged over the weekend that Elliott had built a stake in the company. Elliott has declined to comment on the size of its stake or its intentions but Bloomberg, which first reported the investment, said the hedge fund was preparing to push for \"transformative measures\".\n\nRoger Read at Wells Fargo said Elliott was most likely preparing a letter to shareholders outlining its criticism and its suggested remedies.\n\nThe analysts wrote: \"Based on our experience with Elliott taking activist positions within our coverage universe, the letter would be the next big thing.\n\n\"In the letter, we would expect Elliott to illustrate both BP's alleged shortcomings and a clear path to increase value (likely through some combination of reorganisation/cost reductions, divestment(s), significant debt reduction).\n\n\"Following those efforts, Elliott would likely expect BP to return significant cash to shareholders.\" Elliott, founded in 1977 by billionaire Paul Singer, currently controls $70bn (£56bn) of assets. It has successfully campaigned for change at some of the world's biggest companies, including Starbucks and BHP. The activist fund last year led a successful campaign that saw industrial giant Honeywell split up into three separate companies.\n\nBP has found itself a target after a period of underperformance relative to US rivals and country mate Shell.\n\nUnder Bernard Looney, the previous chief executive, BP set out a plan to pivot to clean energy and reach net zero by 2050. BP pledged to cut its oil and gas production by 40pc by 2030 and increase its investment in low carbon energy by 10-fold.\n\nHowever, the strategy has failed to pay off and proved unpopular with investors. Higher oil and gas prices as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine have seen other companies reap handsome profits and prompted Shell to abandon plans to cut fossil fuel production.\n\nBP is expected to announce a more than 55pc drop in quarterly underlying profits when it reports its latest set of results today.\n\nAnalysts said Elliott would probably press BP to reverse the \"transformation strategy\". Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, has softened many of his predecessor's net zero plans, including cutting the fossil fuel reduction goal from 40pc to 25pc by 2030. Reports suggest that BP could scrap the goal altogether, although Mr Auchincloss has not confirmed that.\n\nIrene Himona, head of European oil and gas at Bernstein, said: \"[BP] needs to explicitly say, 'we're not going to slash our upstream [oil] production'... We need guidance. If you look at the peer group, they do guide to growth.\"\n\nMr Auchincloss is expected to outline a new strategy at a capital markets day on Feb 26. Ms Himona said investors were hoping for further withdrawals from net zero spending.\n\nShe said: \"He's started to reset that strategy, towards a capital light, low carbon model, by forming a joint venture in offshore wind, so by 2030 he would have offloaded cumulated capex of $30bn. He will have to do more of that in regards to solar and biofuels.\"\n\nElliott declined to comment. BP was contacted for comment.\n\nBen Marlow: Page 21",

         "The sale of Eysa (Estacionamientos y Servicios SAU), a technology company dedicated to the management of sustainable mobility and with a relevant position in the management of public and private parking lots, has begun. Its owner, the U.S. fund HIG Capital, has hired JP Morgan and Mediobanca as financial advisors in the divestment process, according to market sources informed 'elEconomista.es'. The company's valuation would exceed 600 million euros.\n\nHIG began preparations for the operation at the end of last year, as this newspaper reported at the beginning of November, and is now formally launching it. The advisors of the American fund, whose headquarters are located in Miami (United States), plan to receive indicative offers from potential interested parties in the second half of next March, while binding proposals would arrive as early as May.",

Among the latter, interest has been aroused both among operators with relevant positions in the parking lot business and in firms that intend to scale in the sustainable mobility activities that Eysa develops from a technological perspective.\n\nHIG is looking to sell Eysa just three years after its acquisition. In December 2021 it signed the purchase of the company from Portobello. Precisely in that operation the fund led in Spain by Jaime Bergel already had as advisor the Italian investment bank Mediobanca, which now repeats for the divestment together with the U.S. entity JP Morgan.\n\nThe amount of the sale of Eysa between HIG and Portobello was not officially disclosed at the time, although in the market it was estimated at around 240 million. The valuation now estimated for Eysa would more than double that price. This increase is due to the improvement in the company's operating ratios, with double-digit growth. Specifically, its gross operating profit (ebitda) already exceeds 50 million euros and the multiples estimated in the market for this type of company is around 12 times, according to sources in the know.\n\nEysa, led by Javier Delgado as CEO, is based in Madrid and provides services in more than 60 countries. It specializes in managing regulated surface and subway parking in major Spanish cities and is also the owner of sustainable mobility solutions and applications (smart mobility).\n\nGrowth through acquisitionsIts growth in recent years is based on both organic activity and the execution of inorganic operations. Among Eysa's most important contracts are the regulated parking lot contract in Madrid, with a weight of close to 20% of its ebitda, and the management of the parking lots at 34 Aena airports, with 120,000 parking spaces.

The deal between the U.K. insurers is likely to go through, though it still needs to get regulatory approval and is set to be voted on next month. The two groups have direct overlap in their operations. Therefore, Aviva should be able to deliver the synergies it has promised, analyst Larissa van Deventer writes. The transaction should be accretive from the first year onwards, she notes. The broker raises its rating on Aviva's stock to overweight from equal weight and lifts its target price to 565 pence from 540 pence. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)",

China economist Zichun Huang attributes the January headline figures showing new local-currency loans at record highs to the usual seasonal pattern, noting that net lending is always strongest at the start of the year. To cut through the seasonality, CE looks at the data in terms of on-year growth in credit outstanding. On that basis, bank lending slowed from December to a fresh low last month, Huang writes. In the coming quarters, she thinks robust government bond issuance can lend support, but weak private demand will likely keep credit growth subdued. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n\n0432 ET - NatWest's profitability guidance could be unsustainable, Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood writes in a research note. The U.K. lender guided for its return on tangible equity--a key measure of profitability--to land in the 15% to 16% range in 2025, and to stay over 15% in 2027. This represents an uplift from its previous guidanceand aligns with consensus expectations.. \"While a RoTE of this magnitude may be achievable in the near-term, we worry whether it will being sustainable over the longer-term given competitive pressure and the risk that such a return could attract the wrong sort of political and regulatory attention,\" Greenwood notes.

The lender's expectations for this year align with consensus estimates. \"The buzz around the sector and better-than-expected results in the final quarter mean investors will have been hoping to get a punchier outlook,\" analyst Matt Britzman writes, adding this might cause weakness in early exchanges. In the longer term, the decent set of results--which slightly beat expectations, closing a 2024 that saw a seismic positive sentiment shift--set up the bank for another good year. Shares open 1.4% lower at 431 pence, bringing its year to date gains to around 7%. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)\n\n0242 ET - NatWest reported a solid set of results and upgraded guidance that aligns with consensus, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says in a research note after the British lender's quarterly print. It guided for a return on tangible equity between 15% and 16% for 2025, while consensus estimates stood at 15.7%. NatWest also guided for total income for the year in the 15.2 billion to 15.7 billion pound range, in line with expectations of 15.5 billion pounds. The lack of share-buyback announcement might be slightly disappointing, analysts write, noting the 15.5 pence-a-share dividend was better than expected.

Loan growth is on track to exceed 4.5%, supported by a strong retail banking segment, he notes. However, net interest margin may slip 5bps sequentially amid typical year-end competition, he reckons. While non-interest income is expected to soften on weak trading income, fee income may remain healthy as RHB continues to generate arbitrage forex returns from its liability management initiatives, he adds. Hong Leong maintains a buy rating on RHB Bank and keeps target price at MYR7.55. Shares are 0.3% higher at MYR6.56. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n\n2225 ET - Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero)'s credit costs may increase this year owing to its clean-up of asset-quality issues, Bahana Sekuritas analysts say in a research report. Management guided for credit costs to rise to 3.0%-3.2% in 2025 versus 2024 guidance of less than 3%. Key assumptions include its bank-only segment carrying out IDR38 trillion-40 trillion of write-offs, while the rest will be allocated to subsidiaries, the analysts note. The bank expects a substantial increase in credit costs in 1Q owing to seasonality and fewer working days affecting collection efforts together with likely liquidity pressures. The analysts lower the stock's target price to IDR5,500.00 from IDR5,600.00 with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are 1.5% lower at IDR3,930.00. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)\n\n2015 ET - Computershare's price-to-earnings is well above its 15-year average, suggesting to Morgan Stanley analyst Andrei Stadnik that the stock's re-rating may have come ahead of schedule. He points out in a note to clients that the share-registry provider's margin income--interest earned on cash held for dividends--is likely to fall from 80% of pretax profit to about 65% in fiscal 2026. Stadnik says the stock is more sensitive to rate moves than either banks or insurers, with EPS growth into fiscal 2026 looking limited. MS lifts its target price 18% to A$36.60 but maintains an equal-weight rating on the stock. Shares are up 0.7% at A$42.875.

IAG's guidance assumes all of its A$1.28 billion natural perils costs will be utilized. Citi, however, thinks it will benefit from A$65 million of favorable weather variance across FY 2025.

In January, spending at liquor stores fell by 5% from a year ago, while spending at bars was up by 1%. Wadford speculates that the \"dry January\" trend could be leading consumers to cut. Abstaining in January is big on social media, and Gen Z led the pullback, spending 15% less on alcohol last month versus a year earlier. He also suggests that some people stocked up on liquor during the pandemic, and are still working on liquor bottles they bought a couple of years ago. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers are hitting the town. They spent 4% more at bars than a year ago last month, the biggest increase among any generation. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)",

D., Sanchís, A., Veses, A., Kapf, A., López, J. M., Callén, M. S., ... & Murillo, R.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe recovery of waste-based feedstocks is an important step in the defossilization of the petrochemical industry and thus in the circular economy for petroleum-based products that have reached the end of their useful life such as end-of-life tires (ELT). This work is part of the European BLACKCYCLE project, and focuses on the distillation performance of tire pyrolysis oil (TPO) obtained from an industrial scale plant, ranked at the ninth technology readiness level (TRL-9). The influence of different reboiler temperatures and reflux ratios on the yields and characteristics of the resulting streams was investigated using a pilot scale packed distillation column under industrially relevant conditions, classified within the fifth technology readiness level (TRL-5). The distillation process was shown to be capable of continuously producing a light fraction (LF) with a very high concentration of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) suitable for high value chemicals. Similarly, a heavy fraction (HF) with a high C/H ratio, high flash point and high presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) is obtained, making it an attractive alternative to carbon black oil. These results are quite outstanding to accomplish the recovery of waste-based value-added feedstocks in such a way that the carbon embedded in the ELT is retained in the petrochemical industry. This work is committed to the development of green, affordable and practical recycling processes to fill the gap in the production of sustainable chemical commodities, while paving the way to address one of the industry's greatest challenges: the defossilization of the petrochemical industry.\n\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/gc/d4gc05185h\n\nThe Industry\n\nThird-largest industry in Germany\n\nWith a 2020 turnover of €190.6 billion, chemicals and pharmaceuticals are the third-largest industry in Germany, behind only automotive and machinery and equipment.\n\nBroad and strong\n\nThe German chemical industry is strong across all segments: basic inorganics, petrochemicals, polymers, agrochemicals, specialties, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. It is also well spread across the country, although some regions are more specialized in basic chemicals, while others focus more on specialties or pharmaceuticals.\n\nAs an enabler of all other industrial sectors, the chemical industry has its role in all economic regions or clusters. To highlight just a few speciﬁc segments, technologies or regions would not be a suitable way to describe the strength of the German chemical industry.\n\nIn 2020 about 2,061 companies partly organized in 40 Chemical Parks employed 464,437 people. After the industrial recession in 2019, the Corona pandemic gave the chemical and pharmaceutical industry a difficult year in 2020. Sales fell by almost 4 per cent to 190.6 billion euros. Compared to other industrial sectors, however, the industry came through the crisis well. A special boom for disinfectants, hygiene products, packaging and medical products as well as stable demand from the construction industry supported the development of chemical and pharmaceutical sales in Germany. 60 percent of total sales were generated with customers abroad.\n\nDevelopment until 2050: A VCI Prognos study \"Wege in die Zukunft\", predicts growth of 1.6% a year until 2050 for the German chemical industry.\n\nAmong the most important trends aﬀecting chemical and pharmaceutical industry are sustainability, climate change, protection of natural resources, and circular economy. The German chemical industry, together with its customers, is developing and implementing new processes and products e.g. with the aim to reach greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050, to use CO2 as an input or to use plastic materials via recycling as feedstock for the next generation of products.\n\nNew technologies such as nano- und biotechnology, the hydrogen economy and digitalization are explored to ﬁnd efficient ways to achieve these goals.\n\nAreas of growth for the chemical industry lie in the topics addressed in the \"High Tech-Strategy\" of the Federal government. Due to digitalization, process and organizational innovations are gaining in relative importance.\n\nProgressing through research\n\nAlmost 80% of German chemical and pharmaceutical companies have research activities, and R&D spending reached €13.7 billion in 2020. While German chemical companies get about 1% of their R&D expenditures through government funding, collaboration between industry and academia is well established: one third of chemical companies collaborate with academia in research projects.\n\nTo maintain its competitive edge, the German chemical industry will enhance its research eﬀort by 2050.\n\nMake the Green Deal an engine for sustainable growth\n\nThe German and European industrial policies are to a large degree shaped by the Commission's EU Green Deal, the Commission's growth strategy for a climate-neutral EU by 2050. The EU Green Deal tackles many areas at once, going from sustainable finance to circular economy, biodiversity, the chemicals strategy for sustainability to clean energy or climate action. Germany supports the goal of the Green Deal to become greenhouse gas neutral in 2050. As massive investments in research, innovation, skills and infrastructure have to be made, industry needs the right framework conditions for the transformation process. As a key parameter, we hope the new Industrial Strategy will be developed further into an effective program to support transformation. One of the most pressing demands is sufficient renewable energy and raw materials (e.g. hydrogen) at competitive prices and to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy for companies. As an export-oriented economy, the transformation process should not create European isolated solutions but be promoted in an open economy, be compatible with WTO rules, consider the international level-playing field and foster international approaches to pursue global climate protection and the other Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nFor the export-oriented German chemical industry, it will be key that international markets remain open, so that the new transformative technologies can be installed globally. At the same time, for a successful and efficient transformation, it will be necessary that our industry can source raw materials products and best available technologies from international markets as well as from domestic markets. The \"open strategic autonomy\" laid out in the new trade and industrial policy strategies of the Commission has to put an emphasis on \"diversification\" when striving for reducing vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile CCfDs will be an important tool for the transformation of our industry to become climate-neutral in an EU of increasing CO2-prices, our complex and export-oriented sector remains skeptical that CBAM could be designed in a way that does more good than harm for our transformation and international relations.\n\nGermany has become part and motor of several of Europe's IPCEIs, e.g. those in batteries and hydrogen. Mote IPCEIs are expected to follow soon.\n\nSource: The European Chemical Industry Council, AISBL\n\nhttps://cefic.org/a-pillar-of-the-european-economy/landscape-of-the-european-chemical-industry/germany/\n\nLeading Companies\n\nBASF Group (FRA : BAS)\n\nThe parent of the global BASF Group is the German company, BASF SE (FRA: BAS).\n\nhttps://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/organization/locations.html\n\nWe create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nWe combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility.\n\nMore than 117,000 employees in the BASF Group work on contributing to the success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost every country in the world.

The company today presented figures for the first quarter of 2024, on the day of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held in the Congress Center Rosengarten in Mannheim, Germany. For this event, BASF expects a similar attendance as in 2023 with around 5,000 shareholders and shareholder representatives.\n\nSales in the first quarter of 2024 amounted to €17.6 billion, €2.4 billion below the figure of the prior-year quarter. This decline in sales was mainly driven by considerably reduced prices as a result of lower raw materials and energy prices in almost all segments as well as lower precious metal prices in the Surface Technologies segment. Negative currency effects contributed to the sales decrease in all segments. Considerable growth in sales volumes in the Chemicals, Materials, Nutrition & Care and Industrial Solutions segments had a positive impact on sales. This more than compensated for lower volumes in the Agricultural Solutions and Surface Technologies segments.\n\nIncome from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) amounted to €2.7 billion, 5.7 percent higher than the average of analysts' estimates. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, EBITDA before special items decreased by €153 million or 5.3 percent. The Nutrition & Care, Materials, Industrial Solutions and Chemicals segments increased EBITDA before special items, in some cases significantly, mainly due to reduced fixed costs as well as predominantly volume-related higher contribution margins. Despite these earnings increases, the BASF Group's EBITDA before special items declined slightly, in particular due to the considerable decline in earnings of Other, which was primarily attributable to higher bonus provisions. The Agricultural Solutions and Surface Technologies segments also recorded lower EBITDA before special items than in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nEBITDA amounted to €2.7 billion compared with €2.8 billion in the prior-year period. The EBITDA margin before special items was 15.4 percent, up from 14.3 percent in the prior-year quarter. At €1.7 billion, EBIT was €177 million below the figure of the prior-year quarter. Depreciation and amortization amounted to €965 million (prior-year quarter: €944 million).\n\nIncome after taxes declined by €193 million compared with the first quarter of 2023 to €1.4 billion. Noncontrolling interests of €43 million were almost at prior-year level. As a result, net income amounted to €1.4 billion (prior-year quarter: €1.6 billion).\n\nDevelopment of cash flows in the first quarter of 2024\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to minus €0.5 billion, compared with minus €1.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily due to lower cash outflow from net working capital. Free cash flow, which was negatively impacted by the typical seasonal increase in receivables in the Agricultural Solutions segment, improved to minus €1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared with minus €1.9 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nDividend proposal of €3.40 per share for the 2023 business year\n\nAs previously announced, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board of BASF SE will propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting a dividend of €3.40 per share, matching the prior-year level. This equates to a payout of €3.0 billion to shareholders of BASF SE. With this proposed dividend, the BASF share offers a high dividend yield of 7.0 percent based on the year-end share price for 2023. BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the 15 companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX 40.\n\nAll shareholders who hold BASF shares as of April 25, 2024, the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, are entitled to receive the dividend. On the ex-dividend day, in this case April 26, 2024, the BASF share will trade with a discount equivalent to the dividend amount of €3.40. The dividend will be paid out on April 30, 2024, assuming the Annual Shareholders' Meeting approves the proposed dividend.\n\nBASF Group outlook for 2024\n\nThe assumptions regarding the global economic environment in 2024 from the BASF Report 2023 remain unchanged:\n\n* Growth in gross domestic product: +2.3%\n\n* Growth in industrial production: +2.2%\n\n* Growth in chemical production: +2.7%\n\n* Average euro/dollar exchange rate of $1.10 per euro\n\n* Average annual oil price (Brent crude) of $80 per barrel\n\nThe BASF Group's forecast for the 2024 business year published in the BASF Report 2023 also remains unchanged:\n\n* EBITDA before special items of between €8.0 billion and €8.6 billion\n\n* Free cash flow of between €0.1 billion and €0.6 billion\n\n* CO2 emissions of between 16.7 million metric tons and 17.7 million metric tons\n\n* The development of the global economy is still subject to uncertainty. The global chemical industry recovered slightly in the first quarter of 2024. It grew considerably faster than overall industrial production because the customer industries somewhat restocked their very low inventories.\n\nhttps://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2024/04/p-24-164.html\n\nBayer Group (FRA: BAYN)\n\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of healthcare and agriculture. We design our products and services to help tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, and to serve the most essential human needs of health and nutrition.\n\nThrough the power of science, we're pioneering new possibilities that advance life. That means reimagining how we care for ourselves and one another by empowering everyday health, improving approaches to patient care, and finding better ways to nourish communities around the world.\n\nhttps://www.bayer.com/en/this-is-bayer\n\nFirst-quarter performance as expected\n\n14/5/2024\n\n* Group sales at 13.765 billion euros (Fx & portfolio adj. minus 0.6 percent), currency headwinds of 525 million euros\n\n* EBITDA before special items falls 1.3 percent to 4.412 billion euros\n\n* Sales and earnings down at Crop Science and Consumer Health\n\n* Pharmaceuticals posts higher sales and earnings\n\n* Core earnings per share at 2.82 euros (minus 4.4 percent)\n\n* Net income at 2.0 billion euros\n\n* Free cash flow at minus 2.626 billion euros\n\n* Currency-adjusted Group outlook confirmed\n\nLeverkusen, May 14, 2024 - The Bayer Group performed as expected in the opening months of the year. \"First-quarter sales declined slightly versus the prior year. The Pharmaceuticals Division saw gains in growth and profitability, and the Crop Science Division outperformed in a difficult market. Consumer Health started slower but is set to get back to growth over the course of the year,\" CEO Bill Anderson said on Tuesday when presenting the company's quarterly statement for the first quarter. He reaffirmed Bayer's outlook for 2024 at constant currencies. Anderson also commented on the company's strategic priorities. \"In March, I highlighted four areas we're focused on to get Bayer back on track. Two months later, we've made progress in each one,\" he said, referring to growth and innovation, the US litigation, cash and deleveraging, and the new Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO) operating model. Regarding the implementation of DSO, Bayer's CEO explained: \"We're consolidating roles, designing teams for more impact, and taking out layers. The most important measure of our impact will be much greater than a job number or a cost savings target. It will be in our ability to innovate, grow our businesses, and improve life for our customers.\"\n\nGroup sales came in at 13.765 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024 and were therefore slightly below the prior-year figure on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis (Fx & portfolio adj. minus 0.6 percent). There was a negative currency effect of 525 million euros (Q1 2023: positive currency effect of 102 million euros). EBITDA before special items decreased by 1.3 percent to 4.412 billion euros. EBIT advanced by 4.0 percent to 3.092 billion euros after net special charges of 207 million euros (Q1 2023: 431 million euros). The special charges primarily related to expenses for ongoing restructuring measures and affected all divisions and functional areas. Net income fell by 8.2 percent to 2.0 billion euros, while core earnings per share decreased by 4.4 percent to 2.82 euros.\n\nFree cash flow came in at minus 2.626 billion euros (Q1 2023: minus 4.102 billion euros), mainly due to the improvement in operating cash flow. Net financial debt as of March 31, 2024, came in at 37.488 billion euros, up 8.7 percent from year-end 2023. This was mainly attributable to cash outflows from operating activities due to seasonal factors.\n\nCrop Science outperforms peers in terms of sales trajectory in a challenging market environment\n\nIn the agricultural business (Crop Science), Bayer outperformed its peers in a difficult market. Sales declined by 3.0 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) to 7.907 billion euros, mainly due to lower volumes for non-glyphosate-based herbicides and the Fungicides business in Europe/Middle East/Africa. With respect to glyphosate-based products, the division recorded significant market-driven price declines in all regions that were not fully offset by the strong volume recovery. The strategic business entities Herbicides and Fungicides saw sales fall by 13.3 percent and 8.5 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.), respectively. Sales at Soybean Seed & Traits were level with the prior-year period (Fx & portfolio adj.). Business at Corn Seed & Traits was up by 2.0 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) thanks to higher prices in all regions, while sales at Insecticides advanced 2.3 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.), driven by increased volumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa and North America.\n\nEBITDA before special items at Crop Science declined by 12.8 percent to 2.849 billion euros, mainly due to price declines for glyphosate-based products. There was also a negative currency effect of 92 million euros (Q1 2023: positive currency effect of 54 million euros).\n\nBusiness up at Pharmaceuticals thanks mainly to new products\n\nSales of prescription medicines (Pharmaceuticals) increased by 3.9 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) to 4.358 billion euros. The division's new products Nubeqa™, a cancer drug, and Kerendia™, for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, both saw sales advance by around two-thirds (Fx & portfolio adj.). In addition, sales of the ophthalmology drug Eylea™ were up 3.4 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) thanks to higher volumes and prices. The Radiology business also posted gains, with the CT Fluid Delivery and Ultravist™ product families both registering growth of around 10 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.). Despite being held back by competitive pressure from generic products, as expected, sales of the oral anticoagulant Xarelto™ were also up, rising 1.7 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.). By contrast, negative developments for the division included a decline in Adalat™ sales due to tender procedures in China. On a global level, sales of the cardiovascular drug decreased by 23.0 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.).\n\nEBITDA before special items at Pharmaceuticals rose by 8.0 percent to 1.194 billion euros. Higher R&D investments for cell and gene therapy and chemoproteomics technologies were offset by lower expenses for projects in advanced clinical development. The division also managed to reduce costs relating to its sales activities. There was a negative currency effect of 127 million euros (Q1 2023: negative currency effect of 6 million euros).\n\nConsumer Health largely able to balance shifting demand with pricing\n\nSales of self-care products (Consumer Health) decreased by 1.8 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) to 1.432 billion euros. The division experienced reduced customer demand following a strong previous quarter in which inventories were replenished due to an improved supply situation. Additionally, US retailers optimized inventory levels across the industry. However, strategic pricing largely offset the decline in volumes. Business in the Allergy & Cold category was down 16.8 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) due to a weaker cold season and mild winter, while sales at Nutritionals were level year on year (Fx & portfolio adj.). By contrast, business was up 9.0 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) at Digestive Health amid an improved supply situation. Growth in Europe, where the division as a whole reported higher sales, was mainly driven by Iberogast™ and Rennie™. Business was also up in the Dermatology category, where sales rose by 7.3 percent (Fx & portfolio adj.) thanks largely to Bepanthen™ Derma and strong demand for regional brands in China.\n\nEBITDA before special items at Consumer Health decreased by 12.7 percent to 331 million euros, mainly due to negative currency effects of 46 million euros (Q1 2023: negative currency effects of 4 million euros). The division was largely able to offset the decline in sales, an inflation-driven rise in costs, and higher investments in marketing innovative products thanks to its continuous cost and price management efforts. It also generated higher income from the sale of minor, non-strategic brands.\n\nCurrency-adjusted outlook confirmed\n\nBayer has confirmed its currency-adjusted forecast for full-year 2024 (i.e. based on the average monthly exchange rates in 2023). However, the negative impact from anticipated currency effects has increased based on the closing rates as of March 31, 2024. Applying the rates on that closing date instead of December 31, 2023, leads to a reduction in the forecast for EBITDA before special items from between 10.4 billion and 11.0 billion euros to between 10.2 billion and 10.8 billion euros, for example.\n\nhttps://www.bayer.com/media/en-us/first-quarter-performance-as-expected/\n\nBP Group (LSE: BP)\n\nThe parent company of the global BP Group is the British company, BP plc (LSE: BP).\n\nhttps://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/what-we-do/bp-at-a-glance/key-business-addresses.html\n\nhttps://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/who-we-are/our-brands.html\n\nBP at a glance.\n\nEach of our brands has its own heritage and personality, but they all have one thing in common - they symbolize, embody or provide tremendous energy\n\nbp is our main global brand.

Compared with the fourth quarter 2023, the result reflects lower oil and gas realizations, the impacts of the Whiting refinery outage and significantly weaker fuels margin, partially offset by significantly lower level of turnaround activity, a strong oil trading result and higher realized refining margins. The underlying effective tax rate (ETR)* in the quarter was 43%.\n\n* Reported profit for the quarter was $2.3 billion, compared with $0.4 billion for the fourth quarter 2023. The reported result for the first quarter is adjusted for inventory holding gains* of $0.7 billion (net of tax) and a net adverse impact of adjusting items* of $1.1 billion (net of tax) to derive the underlying RC profit. Adjusting items pre-tax include net impairment charges of $0.6 billion, largely as a result of regulatory and portfolio changes, and adverse fair value accounting effects* of $0.2 billion.\n\nSegment results\n\n* Gas & low carbon energy: The RC profit before interest and tax for the first quarter 2024 was $1.0 billion, compared with $2.2 billion for the previous quarter. After adjusting RC profit before interest and tax for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $0.6 billion, the underlying RC profit before interest and tax* for the first quarter was $1.7 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2023. The first quarter underlying result reflects lower realizations and foreign exchange losses on Egyptian pound balances, partially offset by lower exploration write-offs. Gas marketing and trading was strong following a strong result in the fourth quarter.\n\n* Oil production & operations: The RC profit before interest and tax for the first quarter 2024 was $3.1 billion, compared with $1.9 billion for the previous quarter. After adjusting RC profit before interest and tax for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $0.1 billion, the underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the first quarter was $3.1 billion, compared with $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2023. The first quarter underlying result reflects lower realizations, partially offset by higher production.\n\n* Customers & products: The RC profit before interest and tax for the first quarter 2024 was $1.0 billion, compared with a loss of $0.6 billion for the previous quarter. After adjusting RC profit before interest and tax for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $0.3 billion, the underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the first quarter was $1.3 billion, compared with $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2023. The customers first quarter underlying result was lower by $0.5 billion, reflecting significantly weaker fuels margin, seasonally lower volumes, and the absence of one-off positive effects that benefited the prior quarter, partly offset by lower costs. The products first quarter underlying result was higher by $1.0 billion, reflecting higher realized refining margins, a significantly lower level of turnaround activity and higher commercial optimization, partially offset by the impacts of the Whiting refinery outage. The oil trading contribution was strong following a weak result in the fourth quarter.\n\nOperating cash flow* $5.0 billion\n\n* Operating cash flow in the quarter of $5.0 billion includes a working capital* build (after adjusting for inventory holding gains, fair value accounting effects and other adjusting items) of $2.4 billion, reflecting seasonal inventory effects, timing of various payments and the price environment. (see page 27).\n\nDelivering the next wave of efficiencies - at least $2 billion cash cost* savings\n\n* bp has a target to deliver at least $2 billion of cash cost savings by the end of 2026 relative to 2023. The reduction is expected to result from cost-saving measures across bp's business underpinned by high-grading the portfolio, digital transformation, supply chain efficiencies and global capability hubs. Some of these cost savings may have associated restructuring charges.\n\nFurther $1.75 billion share buyback announced for 1Q24; $3.5 billion for first half 2024 unchanged\n\n* The $1.75 billion share buyback programme announced with the fourth quarter results was completed on 3 May 2024.\n\n* A resilient dividend is bp's first priority within its disciplined financial frame, underpinned by a cash balance point* of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2021 real). For the first quarter, bp has announced a dividend per ordinary share of 7.270 cents.\n\n* bp is committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. Through the cycle, we are targeting to further improve our credit metrics within an 'A' grade credit range.\n\n* bp continues to invest with discipline and a returns focused approach in our transition growth* engines and in our oil, gas and refining businesses. For 2024 and 2025 we expect capital expenditure of around $16 billion per annum.\n\n* In setting the dividend per ordinary share and buyback each quarter, the board will continue to take into account factors including the cumulative level of and outlook for surplus cash flow*, the cash balance point and maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe commentary above contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement on page 36.\n\n\"We've delivered another resilient quarter financially and continued to make progress on our strategy. Oil production was up and our ACE platform in the Caspian is now producing. We are simplifying and reducing complexity across bp and plan to deliver at least $2 billion of cash cost savings by the end of 2026 through high grading our portfolio, digital transformation, supply chain efficiencies and global capability hubs.\"Murray Auchincloss, chief executive officer\n\nhttps://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/first-quarter-2024-results.html\n\nDow Inc.

We remain focused on working capital, reducing costs, and matching our operating rates to current demand.

Local price decreased 4% year-over-year, due to lower downstream polymer prices primarily in Asia Pacific. Currency was flat. Volume decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by lower merchant hydrocarbon sales, partly offset by higher demand for functional polymers and polyethylene. On a sequential basis, net sales increased by 2%, led by gains in EMEAI.\n\nEquity earnings were $55 million, an increase of $36 million compared to the prior year, led by gains at our principal joint ventures, including Sadara which had planned maintenance turnaround activity in the prior year. Sequentially, equity earnings were up $30 million, driven by gains at our non-principal joint ventures.\n\nOperating EBIT was $703 million, a decrease of $215 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by lower integrated margins, higher planned maintenance activity, and lower non-recurring licensing sales. Sequentially, Op. EBIT increased by $98 million, primarily due to higher integrated margins.\n\nPackaging and Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales decline versus the year-ago period as higher demand for industrial, consumer, and flexible food packaging was more than offset by lower prices, primarily in infrastructure and mobility end-markets, and lower non-recurring licensing sales. Sequentially, net sales increased, led by higher polyethylene sales in the U.S. & Canada, EMEAI, and Latin America.\n\nHydrocarbons & Energy business reported a net sales decline compared to the year-ago period, driven by lower merchant olefin and aromatic sales primarily due to lighter feedslate cracking in EMEAI. Sequentially, net sales decreased slightly due to lower third-party power and steam sales in the U.S. & Canada.\n\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\n\n                                          Three Months Ended Jun 30   Three Months Ended Mar 31   \n In millions, except margin percentages   2Q24                        2Q23                        vs. SQLY [B / (W)]   1Q24     vs. PQ [B / (W)]   \n Net Sales                                $2,951                      $3,177                      $(226)               $3,008   $(57)              \n Operating EBIT                           $7                          $(35)                       $42                  $87      $(80)              \n Operating EBIT Margin                    0.2 %                       (1.1) %                     130 bps              2.9 %    (270) bps          \n Equity Losses                            $(31)                       $(83)                       $52                  $(15)    $(16)              \n\n\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment net sales were $3 billion, down 7% versus the year-ago period. Local price declined 7% year-over-year. Currency decreased net sales by 1%. Volume was up 1% year-over-year, driven by gains in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals. On a sequential basis, net sales decreased 2% as volume gains in Industrial Solutions were more than offset by lower volumes in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals, primarily in the U.S. & Canada, including the impact of a third-party supplier outage.\n\nEquity losses for the segment were $31 million, an improvement of $52 million versus the year-ago period, driven by improved MEG margins at the Kuwait joint ventures. Equity losses in the prior quarter were $15 million. Sequentially, the earnings decline was primarily driven by lower prices and volumes at Sadara.\n\nOperating EBIT was $7 million, an improvement of $42 million versus the year-ago period, driven by improved equity earnings, partly offset by lower integrated margins. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT decreased $80 million, driven by higher planned maintenance activity and equity losses, as well as lower volumes.\n\nPolyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business reported a net sales decrease compared to the year-ago period, driven by local price declines, which were partly offset by volume gains in EMEAI, led by building & construction. Sequentially, net sales decreased as price gains in all geographic regions except Latin America were more than offset by lower volumes in the U.S. & Canada, including the impact of a third-party supplier outage.\n\nIndustrial Solutions business reported a decrease in net sales compared to the year-ago period, driven by local price declines and the impact of an outage at Louisiana Operations, which successfully restarted at the end of June. Sequentially, net sales increased, led by volume gains in Asia Pacific and local price gains in EMEAI and Latin America.\n\nPerformance Materials & Coatings\n\n                                          Three Months Ended Jun 30   Three Months Ended Mar 31   \n In millions, except margin percentages   2Q24                        2Q23                        vs. SQLY [B / (W)]   1Q24     vs. PQ [B / (W)]   \n Net Sales                                $2,243                      $2,197                      $46                  $2,152   $91                \n Operating EBIT                           $146                        $66                         $80                  $41      $105               \n Operating EBIT Margin                    6.5 %                       3.0 %                       350 bps              1.9 %    460 bps            \n Equity Earnings                          $2                          $6                          $(4)                 $6       $(4)               \n\n\nPerformance Materials & Coatings segment net sales in the quarter were $2.2 billion, up 2% versus the year-ago period.

Volume was up 7% year-over-year, driven by gains in both businesses and all geographic regions. On a sequential basis, net sales were up 4%, driven by higher volumes in both businesses, primarily in the U.S. & Canada and Asia Pacific.\n\nOperating EBIT was $146 million, an improvement of $80 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by broad-based business and geographic volume growth. Sequentially, Op. EBIT increased $105 million, driven by volume gains in both businesses and lower planned maintenance activity.\n\nConsumer Solutions business reported a decrease in net sales versus the year-ago period, as higher volumes in all geographic regions and most end-markets, including home & personal care and consumer electronics, were more than offset by lower prices.

Sequentially, net sales increased, driven by seasonally higher demand for pavement markings and architectural coatings.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\n\"As we look to the second half of the year, Team Dow is focused on continuing to deliver sequential earnings improvements while navigating through the slower macro environment we remain in,\" said Fitterling. \"While near-term demand in many markets that we serve is growing, building & construction and consumer durables are unlikely to significantly change in 2024. We will continue driving higher sales through our innovation portfolio and diverse product mix. And, through leveraging our global scale, strategically advantaged cost positions, and counter-cyclical growth investments, we remain on track to enable higher earnings and shareholder returns.\"\n\nhttps://s23.q4cdn.com/981382065/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Dow-2Q24-Earnings-News-Release.pdf\n\nEvonik Group (FRA: EVK)\n\nThe parent company of the global Evonik Group is the German company, Evonik Industries AG (FRA: EVK).\n\nEvonik has production plants in 28 countries and R&D staff at 38 locations around the world.\n\nhttps://corporate.evonik.com/en/company/facts-figures\n\nhttps://corporate.evonik.com/en/company/locations/\n\nWe may not manufacture tires, mattresses, medications, or animal feeds, but Evonik is part of all of those products -and many more. While we often contribute only small amounts of material, those contributions are precisely what make the difference. That's because Evonik products make tires fuel-efficient, mattresses more elastic, medications more effective, and animal feeds healthier. That's what specialty chemicals are all about. And when it comes to specialty chemicals, we're among the best in the world.\n\nEvonik stands for attractive business and innovative prowess. Our corporate culture is geared toward results, profitable growth, and increasing the value of the company. Operating in over 100 countries, we benefit from close customer relationships and leading market positions. Over 32,000 employees are united by the understanding that no product is so perfect that you can't make it better.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, the enterprise generated sales of around € 13,3 billion and an operating profit (adjusted EBITDA) of about € 2.15 billion.\n\nhttps://corporate.evonik.com/en/company/the-creative-power-of-specialty-chemicals-123919.html\n\nEvonik materially lifts outlook for 2024\n\n15/7/2024\n\nPreliminary Financial Data: April 1 to June 30, 2024\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA in second quarter well above prior year\n\n* Further improvement also compared to already good first quarter\n\n* Outlook for full year: Adjusted EBITDA expected between €1.9 billion and €2.2 billion\n\nEssen, Germany. In a difficult environment, Evonik has delivered another strong quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company is therefore publishing preliminary key figures for the second quarter in advance and is materially raising its outlook for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nBased on preliminary and unaudited figures, Evonik achieved an adjusted EBITDA of €578 million in the second quarter, 29 percent above the prior-year figure (Q2 2023: €450 million). Analysts had expected €531 million (Vara consensus as of May 29, 2024). At the same time, the result is another 11 percent higher than the already good first quarter.\n\nAs there was still no broad-based macroeconomic recovery, company-specific factors in particular led to this positive development: In addition to continued strict cost discipline, good volume development in Specialty Additives as well as a price recovery in Animal Nutrition and lower production costs were drivers of the sequential increase.\n\nBased on this development, Evonik is raising its outlook for adjusted EBITDA, lifting the range for the full year 2024 by €200 million. Earnings are now expected to be between €1.9 billion and €2.2 billion (previously: €1.7 billion to €2.0 billion).\n\nFollowing a slight decline in the first quarter, sales in the second quarter were, based on preliminary figures, at just above €3.9 billion and thus around the level of the previous year (Q2 2023: €3.9 billion).\n\nThe strict contingency measures led to lower costs across the Group. This had a positive impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved by 3.1 percentage points year-on-year to 14.7 percent (Q2 2023: 11.6 percent).\n\nEvonik will publish final figures for the second quarter of 2024 as planned on August 1, 2024.\n\nDevelopment of the divisions\n\nWith adjusted EBITDA of €220 million, Specialty Additives was able to increase its already good result from the first quarter by a further 19 percent. Compared to the previous year, earnings were 10 percent higher (Q2 2023: €199 million). The adjusted EBITDA margin climbed to around 23 percent. Compared to the first quarter, sales volumes and thus capacity utilization increased further. Falling raw material prices had a supporting effect.\n\nWith adjusted EBITDA of €140 million, Nutrition & Care doubled earnings compared to the weak previous year (Q2 2023: €71 million). The figure was on the level achieved in the first quarter. This development was primarily due to Animal Nutrition, where further price increases compensated for lower volumes resulting from the shutdown for capacity expansion in Singapore. The shutdown ended as planned at the end of the quarter. Care Solutions continued the positive trend, particularly in the Active Ingredients business. The entire division benefited from lower variable costs.\n\nSmart Materials continued to recover in the second quarter. Compared to the previous year, adjusted EBITDA increased by 41 percent to €171 million (Q2 2023: €122 million). The figure also rose by 8 percent compared to the previous quarter. The operating improvement was even greater because the first quarter had benefited from the sale of a license. The improvement was driven by a slight recovery particularly in inorganic products, as well as lower raw material costs. In the previous year, a planned shutdown of the PA12 plant in Marl, Germany, had had a significant negative impact on earnings.\n\nWith adjusted EBITDA of €52 million, Performance Materials was 17 percent above the previous year's level (Q2 2023: €45 million) and 22 percent above the first quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, disrupted supply chains had a positive impact, particularly in the oxo alcohol and plasticizer businesses.\n\nAs in previous quarters, Technology & Infrastructure / Other positively reflected the Group's contingency measures. However, this was offset by higher provisions totaling around -€30 million, amongst others for variable compensation. Adjusted EBITDA therefore amounted to minus €5 million, compared to a plus of €13 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nhttps://corporate.evonik.com/en/evonik-materially-lifts-outlook-for-2024-253153.html\n\nHenkel Group (FRA: HEN)\n\nThe parent company of the global Henkel Group is the German company, Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (FRA: HEN).\n\nBuilding on a strong legacy of more than 145 years, we are leading the way to reimagine and improve life every day. Today and for generations to come. Through our innovative and sustainable brands and technologies, across our teams around the world.\n\nHenkel holds leading positions in both industrial and consumer businesses: Our portfolio includes well-known hair care products, laundry detergents, fabric softeners as well as adhesives, sealants, and functional coatings.\n\nhttps://www.henkel.com/company\n\nCompany profile\n\nHenkel operates globally with a well-balanced and diversified portfolio. The company holds leading positions with its two business units in both industrial and consumer businesses thanks to strong brands, innovations and technologies. Founded in 1876, Henkel looks back on more than 147 years of success. Henkel's preferred shares are listed in the German stock index DAX. The DAX-40 company has its headquarters in Düsseldorf, Germany. Henkel employs about 48,000 people worldwide, around 83 percent of whom work outside of Germany. As a recognized leader in sustainability, Henkel holds top positions in many international ratings and rankings.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the company reported sales of 21.5 billion euros and an operating profit of 2.6 billion euros (adjusted for one-time gains/charges and restructuring charges).\n\nhttps://www.henkel.com/press-and-media/facts-and-figures/company-profile\n\nHenkel delivers strong organic sales growth in the first quarter\n\n8/5/2024\n\n* Group sales: around 5.3 billion euros, organic growth of 3.0 percent\n\n* Organic sales increase driven by both business units:\n\n* Adhesive Technologies: positive organic sales growth of 1.3 percent\n\n* Consumer Brands: very strong organic sales growth of 5.2 percent\n\n* Acquisitions of Seal for Life Industries and Vidal Sassoon in China closed earlier than anticipated\n\n* Further progress in implementing strategic growth agenda\n\n* Outlook for fiscal 2024 significantly raised on May 3:\n\n* Organic sales growth: 2.5 to 4.5 percent (previously: 2.0 to 4.0 percent)\n\n* Adjusted return on sales: 13.0 to 14.0 percent (previously: 12.0 to 13.5 percent)\n\n* Adjusted earnings per preferred share (EPS): Increase in the range of +15.0 to +25.0 percent at constant exchange rates (previously: +5.0 to +20.0 percent)\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Henkel achieved Group sales of around 5.3 billion euros and generated strong organic sales growth of 3.0 percent. The increase was driven by a positive price development in both business units. Volume development at Group level, which is still being impacted by the portfolio measures in the Consumer Brands business unit, showed a further sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In nominal terms, sales were down -5.2 percent compared to the prior-year quarter - predominantly due to the sale of the business activities in Russia and to negative foreign exchange effects.\n\n\"We had a very good start to the year. In addition, we were able to close the acquisitions of Seal for Life Industries and Vidal Sassoon in China faster than anticipated and will thus further strengthen our businesses,\" said Carsten Knobel, CEO of Henkel. \"In light of these developments, we significantly raised our sales and earnings outlook for 2024 last week. This demonstrates: We have a clear strategy which we are executing on stringently. We deliver on what we have promised. And we are on the right track for further profitable growth.\"\n\nThe positive organic sales increase of the Adhesive Technologies business unit in the first quarter was primarily driven by strong organic sales growth in the Mobility & Electronics business area. Very strong organic sales growth in the Consumer Brands business unit was fueled by all business areas, with a particular contribution coming from the Hair business.\n\nGroup sales performance\n\nGroup sales in the first quarter of 2024 totaled 5,317 million euros, a nominal decrease of -5.2 percent compared to the prior-year quarter (5,609 million euros). Organically (i.e. adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments), sales increased by 3.0 percent. The strong organic sales growth at Group level was driven by pricing. Acquisitions/divestments reduced sales by -4.3 percent. Foreign exchange effects had a further negative impact of -3.9 percent on sales development.\n\nOrganic sales growth in the Europe region amounted to 2.5 percent in the first quarter. In the IMEA region, sales increased organically by 26.9 percent. The North America region posted a negative organic sales development of -3.0 percent. In Latin America, sales were organically -2.7 percent below the prior-year quarter. The Asia-Pacific region achieved organic sales growth of 3.5 percent.\n\nSales performance Adhesive Technologies\n\nThe Adhesive Technologies business unit achieved sales of 2,677 million euros in the first quarter of 2024, representing a nominal decrease of -4.1 percent compared to the prior-year quarter (2,791 million euros). Organically (i.e. adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments), sales increased by 1.3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2023. Both price and volume showed a positive development. Foreign exchange effects reduced sales by -3.8 percent. Acquisitions/divestments had a further negative effect of -1.7 percent.\n\nThe positive organic sales development of the Adhesive Technologies business unit in the first quarter was primarily fueled by the Mobility & Electronics business area, which achieved a strong increase of 3.7 percent. This growth was driven by the Automotive and Electronics businesses. The Industrial business showed a positive development. In a continuously challenging market environment, the Packaging & Consumer Goods business area recorded an overall flat organic sales development of -0.2 percent, which was supported by a positive volume development. The Packaging business achieved positive growth, benefiting from first signs of improvement in demand. The Consumer Goods business recorded a slight decline compared to a very strong prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth in the Craftsmen, Construction & Professional business area was at 0.3 percent versus the prior-year quarter. This was particularly supported by the Construction business which achieved good growth. The General Manufacturing & Maintenance business showed an overall negative performance, which was primarily due to the currently challenging market environment.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, the organic sales performance of the Adhesive Technologies business unit was mixed. In Europe, sales overall were organically below the prior-year quarter, even though the Craftsmen, Construction & Professional business area achieved positive organic growth. While North America recorded a positive organic sales increase in the Mobility & Electronics business area, overall sales performance in the region was below that of the prior-year quarter. The IMEA region achieved double-digit organic sales increase, with all business areas contributing with double-digit growth rates. Latin America posted a negative organic sales development in all business areas. By contrast, sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was very strong - mainly driven by a significantly positive development in China, which was supported by first signs of a stabilizing market environment following the challenging conditions encountered in the prior year.\n\nSales performance Consumer Brands\n\nIn the Consumer Brands business unit, sales in the first quarter of 2024 totaled 2,605 million euros, a nominal decrease of -6.0 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Organically (i.e. adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments), sales increased by 5.2 percent. Pricing in the business unit remained very strong compared to the first quarter of 2023. Volumes declined slightly, particularly due to the impacts of the ongoing portfolio measures. Foreign exchange effects had a negative impact of -4.0 percent on sales. Acquisitions/divestments reduced sales by a further -7.2 percent.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Laundry & Home Care business area generated very strong organic sales growth of 4.6 percent. The Laundry business posted strong growth, mainly driven by a double-digit increase in the Fabric Care category. The Home Care business achieved significant organic sales growth, which was particularly fueled by a double-digit sales increase in the Toilet Care category and very strong growth in the Dishwashing category.\n\nThe Hair business area achieved very strong organic sales growth of 6.9 percent. Growth in the Consumer business was significant, driven in particular by the Hair Styling category. The Professional business achieved very strong organic sales growth.\n\nThe Other Consumer Businesses posted a strong organic sales increase of 3.4 percent.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, the Consumer Brands business unit recorded a mixed development in the period under review. The Europe region achieved a very strong organic sales increase in the first quarter, driven by both the Hair and the Laundry & Home Care business areas. The North America region recorded a negative organic sales development, mainly due to the portfolio measures implemented in the Laundry & Home Care business area. The IMEA region achieved double-digit organic sales growth across all business areas. The positive organic sales increase in Latin America was driven by the Hair business area, with both the Consumer and the Professional businesses contributing to growth. Sales growth was flat in the Asia-Pacific region, supported by the Laundry & Home Care business area.\n\nNet assets and financial position of the Group\n\nNo substantial changes to the net assets and financial position of the Group occurred in the period under review compared to the situation as at December 31, 2023.\n\nOutlook for the Henkel Group\n\nThe guidance for fiscal 2024, which was published on March 4, 2024, was raised as of May 3.\n\nFor the current year, Henkel now expects organic sales growth of 2.5 to 4.5 percent (previously: 2.0 to 4.0 percent). For Adhesive Technologies, organic sales growth is still expected in the range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent. For Consumer Brands, the company now anticipates an organic sales increase of 3.0 to 5.0 percent (previously: 2.0 to 4.0 percent).\n\nAdjusted return on sales (adjusted EBIT margin) at Group level is now expected to be in the range of 13.0 to 14.0 percent (previously: 12.0 to 13.5 percent). For Adhesive Technologies, adjusted return on sales is now anticipated to be between 16.0 and 17.0 percent (previously: 15.0 to 16.5 percent) and for Consumer Brands in the range of 12.0 to 13.0 percent (previously: 11.0 to 12.5 percent).\n\nFor adjusted earnings per preferred share (EPS), Henkel now expects an increase in the range of +15.0 to +25.0 percent at constant exchange rates (previously: +5.0 to +20.0 percent).\n\nHenkel has also updated the following expectations:\n\n* Acquisitions/Divestments: neutral impact on nominal sales growth\n\n* (previously: negative impact in the low single-digit percentage range)\n\n* Translation of sales in foreign currencies: negative impact in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range\n\n* (previously: negative impact in the mid-single-digit percentage range)\n\nThe following expectations for 2024 have remained unchanged:\n\n* Prices for direct materials: flat development1\n\n* Restructuring expenses of 250 to 300 million euros\n\n* Cash outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of between 650 and 750 million euros\n\nhttps://www.henkel.com/press-and-media/press-releases-and-kits/2024-05-08-henkel-delivers-strong-organic-sales-growth-in-the-first-quarter-1959298\n\nLanxess Group (FRA: LXS)\n\nThe parent company of the global Lanxess Group is the German company, Lanxess AG (FRA: LXS).\n\nLANXESS at a glance.\n\nWe are a leading speciality chemicals company based in Cologne.

Further support came from the successful implementation of LANXESS' cost saving program. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, sales volumes increased in some customer industries, albeit offset by a persistent weak demand for agro chemicals and ongoing difficult market conditions in the construction industry.\n\nLANXESS CEO Matthias Zachert: \"We are benefiting from the fact that we have consistently adjusted our cost structures in recent months and have become more efficient: wherever demand picks up further, we will be in a far better position to benefit from it. Although we do not see any signs of a broad market recovery, we are confident, that we are well positioned as we have successfully strengthened our portfolio towards sustainability and market leadership over the past few years.\"\n\nLANXESS confirms the full-year EBITDA pre guidance of an expected growth of 10 to 20 percent versus previous year and now expects EBITDA pre for the third quarter 2024 to be close or up to the level of the second quarter.\n\nLANXESS will release its full results for the second quarter of 2024 on August 9, 2024.\n\nhttps://lanxess.com/en/media/press-releases/2024/07/ebitda-pre-exceptionals-second-quarter-2024-above-market-expectation\n\nLinde plc (FRA: LIN, NYSE: LIN)\n\nThe United Kingdom company, Linde plc (NYSE: LIN, FRA: LIN) formed from the merger of the German company, Linde AG, the former parent of the Linde Group, and the United States company, Praxair Inc. in 2018.\n\nLinde plc has subsidiaries worldwide.\n\nhttps://www.linde.com/about-linde/corporate-heritage\n\nhttps://www.praxair.com/the-new-linde\n\nWe are a leading global industrial gases and engineering company, serving a variety of end markets such as chemicals and energy, food and beverages, electronics, healthcare, manufacturing, metals and mining.\n\nEvery day around the world, our people are inspired to make our world more productive - by delivering innovative solutions, technologies and services which make our customers more successful and help to sustain, decarbonize and protect our planet.\n\nOur industrial gases and technologies are used in countless applications including production of clean hydrogen and carbon capture systems critical to the energy transition, life-saving medical oxygen and high-purity and specialty gases for electronics.

During the quarter, the company recognized identified items of $28 million, net of tax. These items, which impacted first quarter earnings by $0.09 per share, were related to costs incurred from plans to exit the refining business. First quarter 2024 EBITDA was $1.0 billion, or $1.1 billion excluding identified items.\n\nIn North America, lower costs for natural gas-based feedstocks and energy benefited olefins and polyolefins margins while regional demand for polyethylene improved. The company's North American volumes were constrained by downtime in olefins, polyolefins, propylene oxide, oxyfuels and acetyls. In Europe, logistics disruptions in the Red Sea restricted competitive imports and led to increased volumes from LYB's local assets for olefins, polyethylene, polypropylene and propylene oxide and derivatives. Globally, tepid demand for durable goods continued to challenge volumes and margins for polypropylene and propylene oxide.\n\nThe company remains committed to its balanced and disciplined capital allocation strategy. In the first quarter, LYB used $114 million of cash for operating activities, invested $483 million in capital expenditures for the businesses and returned $408 million to shareholders through dividends. The use of cash by operating activities during the quarter was due to a build in working capital driven by expected seasonality as well as higher volumes and prices in several businesses. During the first quarter, LYB successfully issued $750 million of bonds to refinance our 2024 maturity at a lower interest rate. At the end of the quarter, the company held $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $6.5 billion in available liquidity.\n\nLYB is methodically building a profitable Circular & Low Carbon Solutions (CLCS) business as one of the key pillars of our three-pillar corporate strategy. Since 2019, sales volumes of the company's recycled and renewable-based polymers have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 55 percent. LYB produced and marketed over 120 thousand tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers in 2023(c).\n\n\"LyondellBasell remains focused on unlocking significant value through our strategy while managing challenging market conditions. Our team continues to grow our CLCS business, with LYB building capabilities across the value chain, from upstream plastic waste sourcing to providing recycled and renewable-based polymers that meet the increasing demand from our customers,\" said Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nIn the second quarter, the company expects seasonal demand improvements across most businesses. Low costs for natural gas and NGLs should continue to benefit margins from LYB's North American and Middle East production relative to higher oil-based costs in most other regions. With the start of the summer driving season, oxyfuels and refining margins are expected to increase with higher gasoline crack spreads and lower butane costs. During the second quarter, LYB expects to operate its assets in line with market demand with average operating rates of 85% for global olefins and polyolefins assets and 80% for the Intermediates & Derivatives assets. The company continues to monitor targeted stimulus efforts and remains watchful for demand improvements in China.\n\n\"One year after launching our new strategy, the LYB team continues to be highly focused on execution, accountability and delivering results. Sales volumes for recycled and renewable-based polymers are rapidly growing through our comprehensive approach to building a leading CLCS business. We will extend this growth with continued development of our integrated hubs in Cologne and Houston,\" said Vanacker.\n\nhttps://www.lyondellbasell.com/en/news-events/corporate--financial-news/lyondellbasell-reports-first-quarter-2024-earnings/\n\nMerck Group (FRA: MRK)\n\nThe parent company of the global Merck Group is the German company, Merck KGaA (FRA: MRK).\n\nThe United States company, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) is an independent company and not a subsidiary of Merck KGaA.\n\nhttps://www.merckgroup.com/en/company/who-we-are/history/milestones.html\n\nOur pursuit is progress for people everywhere. That's why we take a closer look at things, ask questions and think ahead.\n\nWe've been around for more than 350 years, yet our majority owners are still the descendants of Friedrich Jacob Merck, the man who founded our company in Darmstadt, Germany in 1668.\n\nSince then, we have become a truly global company. Around 57,000 employees work to make a positive difference to millions of people's lives every day by creating more joyful and sustainable ways to live.\n\nFrom advancing gene editing technologies and discovering unique ways to treat the most challenging diseases to enabling the intelligence of devices - the company is everywhere. In 2019, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, generated sales of € 16.2 billion in 66 countries.\n\nWe are Merck. The only exceptions are the United States and Canada. Here we operate as EMD Serono in the Biopharma business, as MilliporeSigma in the Life Science business, and as EMD Performance Materials in the materials business.\n\nhttps://www.merckgroup.com/en/company/who-we-are.html\n\nMerck off to a Good Start in Fiscal 2024 - 15/5/2024\n\nThe positive development of Healthcare and Electronics largely compensated for the decline in Life Science.\n\nFinancial results of Q1 2024\n\n* Healthcare with strong performance\n\n* Electronics increases sales and earnings organically, driven by higher demand for semiconductor materials\n\n* Inventory destocking in Life Science continues; sales recovery expected in the second half of the year\n\n* Net sales down organically by 1.2% to € 5.1 billion\n\n* EBITDA pre decreases organically by 5.2% to € 1.5 billion\n\nForecast for fiscal 2024\n\n* Qualitative guidance confirmed with Merck returning to organic growth\n\n* Net sales: in a range of € 20.6 billion to € 22.1 billion, organically +1% to +5%\n\n* EBITDA pre: in a range of € 5.7 billion to € 6.3 billion, organically +1% to +7%\n\nMerck, a leading science and technology company, has had a good start to fiscal 2024. The Healthcare business sector performed strongly. Electronics also delivered solid organic sales growth, mainly driven by Semiconductor Solutions. Life Science recorded sales and earnings declines compared with the particularly high base of the year-earlier quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, thanks to the sound business performance and compared with the high base of the first quarter of 2023, Group sales decreased by only 3.3% (organically: ‑1.2%) to € 5,120 million. Foreign exchange effects, mainly from the Chinese renminbi, had a negative impact of 2.0% on the sales development. EBITDA pre fell by 8.4% (organically: ‑5.2%) to € 1,454 million. Negative foreign exchange effects impacted EBITDA pre by 3.2%. The EBITDA pre margin was 28.4% in the first quarter of 2024 and earnings per share pre were € 2.06.\n\n\"We had a good start to the year and gained initial momentum in the first quarter of 2024, once again benefiting from our diversified business model,\" said Belén Garijo, Chair of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck. \"We expect acceleration in the second half of the year, especially in Life Science, and thus a gradual return to organic growth for the Group in fiscal 2024.\"\n\nLife Science: Decline in first quarter against high comparables, in line with expectation of a softer first half of the year\n\nNet sales of the Life Science business sector declined organically by 12.6% against the particularly high base of the first quarter of 2023. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 1.2% on the sales development. Overall, sales of the business sector decreased by 13.8% to € 2,144 million in the first quarter of 2024. The main reason for this was the continued inventory destocking by customers of Process Solutions. Net sales of this business unit declined organically by 19.0%. As a positive signal, order income in Process Solutions increased sequentially as well as year-on-year. Merck expects customers to reach their target inventory levels by the end of the second quarter of 2024. However, due to the manufacturing and delivery times for products ordered by customers, this will significantly increase sales only in the second half of the year. In addition to inventory destocking, the phase-out of Covid-19-related demand was also a headwind for the business development of Life Science in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCompared with the high year-earlier figure, EBITDA pre of Life Science decreased organically by 30.3% and amounted to € 611 million. This was due, among other things, to the lower sales volume and the lower share of higher-margin products sold. The EBITDA pre margin of the business sector was 28.5%, a sequential increase against the 26.3% EBITDA pre margin in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nHealthcare: Double-digit organic sales growth of \"Wave 1\" products, further supported by strong performance of established product portfolio\n\nThe Healthcare business sector performed strongly across all franchises in the first quarter of 2024 amid the market recovery in mainland China, where the year-earlier quarter had been adversely affected by the high rate of Covid‑19 infections.\n\nSales of Healthcare rose organically by 10.1%. Including negative foreign exchange effects of 2.6%, sales increased overall by 7.5% to € 2,048 million. The \"Wave 1\" products Bavencio (+14.2%) and Mavenclad (+12.2%) achieved double-digit organic sales increases. The oncology drug Erbitux delivered very strong organic sales growth of 19.3%, boosted by the softer year-earlier comparables in mainland China. Net sales of the Fertility (+7.7%) and Cardiovascular, Metabolism & Endocrinology (+4.2%) franchises also rose organically.\n\nEBITDA pre of Healthcare went up organically by 28.3% to € 708 million, supported by the regaining of the exclusive worldwide rights to Bavencio and strong sales momentum. The EBITDA pre margin was 34.6%.\n\nElectronics: Positive start to the year, full market inflection still expected in the second half of the year\n\nElectronics delivered solid organic sales growth of 6.3%. This was particularly driven by Semiconductor Solutions, the sector's largest business unit, which grew organically by 7.8%. The main reason for this was increased demand for certain semiconductor materials, for example materials used for leading-edge logic chips. However, Merck does not yet view this as a general inflection point, since demand in other end markets remained soft. The other two business units, Display Solutions (+4.2%) and Surface Solutions (+1.8%), also recorded organic sales increases. Amid negative foreign exchange effects of 3.2%, sales of the Electronics business sector rose overall by 3.1% to € 928 million.\n\nEBITDA pre increased organically by 3.9% compared with the year-earlier quarter. Due to negative foreign exchange effects of 4.2%, the earnings development saw a slight decline by 0.3% to € 237 million overall. The EBITDA pre margin of Electronics was 25.5%.\n\nForecast for fiscal 2024: Qualitative guidance confirmed with Merck returning to organic growth\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Merck expects to return to organic sales and earnings growth for the Group. In particular, the company assumes the following development, in line with its qualitative guidance provided in March 2024:\n\n* Net sales: in a range of € 20.6 billion to € 22.1 billion with organic growth of +1% to +5% and foreign exchange effects of ‑3% to 0%.\n\n* EBITDA pre: in a range of € 5.7 billion to € 6.3 billion with organic growth of +1% to +7% and negative foreign exchange effects of ‑4% to ‑1%.\n\n* EPS pre: € 8.05 to € 9.10.\n\nhttps://www.merckgroup.com/en/news/q1-2024-15-05-2024.html",

Luigi Vignola and Rajesh Manwani will co-lead the unit.\n\n– ABN Amro Bank NV is pausing hiring to keep costs in line with its full-year guidance of €5.3 billion for 2025, Bloomberg reported. The bank finds the hiring freeze necessary following a sharp increase in staff count and consultancy expenses in 2024. The increase in staff levels was mainly due to added resources for data capabilities and regulatory programs.\n\n– UBS Group AG CEO Sergio Ermotti said during an annual general meeting that the bank was on track with its plan to \"substantially complete\" the integration of Credit Suisse by the end of 2026. Account migration in Switzerland should be completed in the first half of 2026. Chairman Colm Kelleher, meanwhile, criticized a proposal by the Swiss government to legally increase the bank's capital requirements, saying it would require an \"extreme\" rise of 50% in capital and hamper the bank's competitiveness, Bloomberg reported.\n\nFeatured during the week on S&P Capital IQ Pro:\n\nEurope's 50 largest banks by assets, 2025\n\nHSBC's revamp affirms pivot to Asia, aids future growth in wealth management\n\nSantander's US reset faces early test from tariff turbulence\n\nLoan growth to drive central European banks' 2025 interest income amid rate cuts",
