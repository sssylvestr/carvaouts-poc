(A-/Stable/F1, A deposit rating) as the cash reserves held at this entity represent the only source of structural CE for these notes and the sudden loss of these funds would imply a downgrade of 10 or more notches. The rating cap reflects the excessive counterparty dependence on the TAB holding the cash reserves, in accordance with Fitch's counterparty criteria.",

In fact, the BOC revised down the amount of slack, or \"modest excess supply\" it believes is in the economy. The output gap estimate goes from -0.75% to -1.75% to -0.25% to -1.25%. Macklem adds the tariff threat weighed on senior officials during rate-policy deliberations, and that reinforced the BOC's decision to cut further. \"The more we can get the economy on a solid footing before it faces new tariffs, the better,\" Macklem says.

This uptick preceded Amazon's new policy requiring employees to work in-office five days a week starting January 2025, up from three days. Previously, rents peaked at nearly $2,500 before the 2020 pandemic, dropping to $1,399 by February 2021 as remote work became prevalent. Post-reopening, demand pushed rents up to $3,118 by August 2022, but they've since fallen by 36% due to increased apartment construction. While longer commutes suggest an impact from Amazon's policy, Redfin says it is premature to link this directly to the rent increase, considering many workers already live close to downtown.

         "\n\n1049 ET - The U.S. trade deficit in goods jumps to $122.1 billion in December, up 18% from $103.5 billion in November, according to the Commerce Department. The larger deficit reflects a $10.8 billion rise in goods imports and a $7.8 billion decline in goods exports. Higher imports likely reflect U.S. companies' efforts to ramp up trade at the end of 2024 to get ahead of potential Trump administration tariffs. Most of the rise in imports came in the industrial-supplies category, imports of which grew to $67.05 billion in December, from $56.41 billion a month earlier. The Commerce Department report also showed small declines in wholesale and retail inventories in December versus November. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)\n\n1049 ET - Brinker International turned heads with massive comparable sales growth at Chili's Grill & Bar that Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro is calling \"other worldly.\" The chain's comps were up 31% year-over-year, way above the already-high 20.5% consensus estimate of analysts polled by FactSet, and Vacarro's own forecast for 23%. The gains came from a nearly 20% jump in traffic and an unexpected 6.6% increase in mix, Vaccaro says. More details on the mysterious mix gain should come from management's call with analysts this morning. Shares climb 15% to $178.

    "You are an expert financial analyst specializing in identifying potential corporate carve-out opportunities in the financial services sector.\n",
    "Your task is to analyze news articles to determine whether they indicate a company is considering divesting part of its business in the future.\n",
    "Focus on European financial services companies across ALL segments including banking, wealth management, insurance, financial data,\n",
    "payment processing, fund administration, brokers, and other financial services.\n",

    "# Instructions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:\n",
    "1. MUST IDENTIFY AS CARVE-OUT PROSPECT:\n",
    "   - Company signals intention to divest specific business units or segments\n",
    "   - Company announces strategic refocusing that implies non-core units could be sold\n",
    "   - New strategic plans mentioning focus on specific segments (implying others might be divested)\n",
    "   - Language about simplifying corporate structure or streamlining operations\n",
    "   - References to non-core assets, underperforming units, or subscale operations\n",
    "   - Management discussing 'evaluating options' for specific business segments\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. MUST NOT BE INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS CARVE-OUT:\n",
    "   - Simple stake sales without business unit separation \n",
    "   - Private equity firms exiting investments (not corporate carve-outs)\n",
    "   - IPO plans without specific business unit divestiture\n",
    "   - Already completed carve-outs (though mention these in reasoning as potentially interesting)\n",
    "   - General M&A activity without specific divestiture signals\n",
    "   - Opinion pieces or columns without factual business announcements\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. TIMING RELEVANCE:\n",
    "   - FOCUS ON FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES: Companies currently considering or likely to consider divestitures\n",
    "   - DE-PRIORITIZE: Already completed transactions (though note these in reasoning)\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. KEY SIGNALS OF POTENTIAL CARVE-OUTS:\n",
    "   - New CEO appointments or management changes\n",
    "   - Announcements of strategic reviews or new strategic plans\n",
    "   - Explicit focus on 'core businesses' or 'key segments'\n",
    "   - Financial pressure (debt issues, dividend concerns, performance challenges)\n",
    "   - Regulatory challenges that might prompt divestiture\n",
    "   - Simplification of corporate structure\n",
    "   - Discontinuation of operations in certain areas\n",
    "    \n",
    "When selecting target_company_code:\n",
    "- If multiple companies might be considering divestitures, select the primary/most likely one\n",
    "- For corporate groups where a parent may divest subsidiaries, consider both parent and subsidiary codes\n",
    "- If a company is refocusing on specific segments, this implies other segments could be divested\n",
    "- Do not pick the wrong company - target company is the one that may divest a subsidiary, a subsidiary is the one that may be divested\n",

(A-/Stable/F1, A deposit rating) as the cash reserves held at this entity represent the only source of structural CE for these notes and the sudden loss of these funds would imply a downgrade of 10 or more notches.

Triple Dippers made up about 14% of total sales at Chili's for 2Q. The campaign brought in younger guests, drove up average check size and prompted more diners to return, the CEO says.

In fact, the BOC revised down the amount of slack, or \"modest excess supply\" it believes is in the economy. The output gap estimate goes from -0.75% to -1.75% to -0.25% to -1.25%. Macklem adds the tariff threat weighed on senior officials during rate-policy deliberations, and that reinforced the BOC's decision to cut further. \"The more we can get the economy on a solid footing before it faces new tariffs, the better,\" Macklem says.

         "\n\n1233 ET - Downtown Seattle's apartment rents increased for the first time in 17 months in December 2024, with a 2.5% year-over-year rise to a median of $2,000, according to Redfin. This uptick preceded Amazon's new policy requiring employees to work in-office five days a week starting January 2025, up from three days. Previously, rents peaked at nearly $2,500 before the 2020 pandemic, dropping to $1,399 by February 2021 as remote work became prevalent. Post-reopening, demand pushed rents up to $3,118 by August 2022, but they've since fallen by 36% due to increased apartment construction. While longer commutes suggest an impact from Amazon's policy, Redfin says it is premature to link this directly to the rent increase, considering many workers already live close to downtown.

Traffic was up about 20%, sweeping past analyst expectations, thanks to Brinker's marketing team \"bringing guests in and putting Chili's back in culture again,\" CEO Kevin Hochman says on a call with analysts. The marketing team made traffic its \"obsession metric\" for the quarter, the CEO says. The gains came despite overall spending on advertising being flat year-over-year, with higher spending set to come in the back half of the fiscal year, CFO Mika Ware says on the same call. \"Our marketing team continues to do an excellent job bringing Chilli's back into the cultural conversation and making the brand relevant again,\" the CFO says.

In December, it signaled rates could be headed down further but a gradual pace. Gov. Tiff Macklem told reporters that the missing guidance is easy to explain, and circles back to President Trump's tariff threat. \"There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and it just didn't seem very useful to provide guidance,\" he says at press conference. Macklem says future rate decisions will depend on which of the forces is more powerful: either the expected downward hit to growth from tariffs of 25%; or the upward pressure on prices for Canadians as the government here retaliates.

Still, the public could be overestimating the timeline to public launch given that, nearly a year since approval, Waymo remains testing in San Francisco freeways, the analysts say. Overall, Lyft is facing competitive intensity, too, after Bloomberg reported that Uber is developing a price lock pass for riders that would allow riders to save up to $50 per month, the analysts add. BofA Securities cuts its target price to $19 from $21 a share previously given the higher long-term autonomous vehicles uncertainty. Lyft shares fall 3.2% to $13.52.

The larger deficit reflects a $10.8 billion rise in goods imports and a $7.8 billion decline in goods exports. Higher imports likely reflect U.S. companies' efforts to ramp up trade at the end of 2024 to get ahead of potential Trump administration tariffs. Most of the rise in imports came in the industrial-supplies category, imports of which grew to $67.05 billion in December, from $56.41 billion a month earlier. The Commerce Department report also showed small declines in wholesale and retail inventories in December versus November.

         "\n\nMeanwhile, Crystal Amber’s shareholders had voted for its assets to be sold and the fund to be wound up. Richard Bernstein, who heads Crystal Amber, accused De La Rue’s management of squandering cost savings with price cuts to chase volumes. He said that the management should have renegotiated its banking covenants earlier; that its professional advisers were charging too much, and that dithering about closing its Kenyan operations had lost cash. Doubts about the group’s viability threatened its current and potential contracts. He called for someone new to chair the group. Since May 2023, when Clive Whiley took over, the share price has been slowly recovering.\n\nLast July, the IC's Simon Thompson spotted that De La Rue’s directors had said that they were talking to outside parties about selling off most of the group. He said that a smart way to invest was through shares in Crystal Amber. Three months later, De La Rue announced a conditional sale of its authentication division to Crane NXT for £300mn. Debt would be paid down and the outsized pension deficit reduced. In December, the company flagged other discussions about the rest of the group. Last week, it confirmed that a bid was in the offing.\n\nDe La Rue under pressure as it awaits £300mn sale\n\nCrystal Amber owns just over 16 per cent of De La Rue, about the same as Aberforth and Schroders. These three institutions hold about half of De La Rue’s shares in issue. For Bernstein, it’s been a long haul. Once Crystal Amber manages to offload its stake, it will hold only one major investment.",

         "\n\nAdvTech\n\nThings have been going pretty well for private education business AdvTech ever since an audacious hostile bid from upstart rival Curro some years ago — which was staved off — motivated leadership to take a more aggressive growth tack. There can’t be too many unhappy shareholders at AdvTech, whose share price has soared more than 200% in five years. But there is always room for improvement, and when you have a shareholder such as Value Capital Partners on board, there might be an incentive to work harder for even better returns. The conspicuous drag on AdvTech is its resourcing (and training) segment — which, at a stretch, has only a slight strategic fit with the more profitable schools and tertiary education hubs. The uneven longer-term performance from the resourcing segment detracts from the core education businesses, which have proper moats. What’s stopping AdvTech? Perhaps finding a buyer for what is a sprawling resourcing segment that is almost certainly too large for either listed counters Primeserv or Adcorp to consider.",

         "\n\n— With The Finance Ghost\n\nArgent Industrial/Trellidor\n\nArgent now earns the bulk of its profits from a cluster of specialist engineering businesses in the UK. The group has been open about securing a listing on the LSE — most likely via a reverse-listing. UK investors would probably not be terribly interested in Argent’s South Africa-based businesses, which include fireplace maker JetMaster, Castor & Ladder and security products business Xpanda. Separating the UK and local businesses could leave the latter open to corporate action to bulk up and diversify operations. Listed safety products group Trellidor might make an obvious and interesting target for Argent — though the domination of the local security products sector might draw the ire of competition authorities. Perhaps a more inspired deal is for Argent to look at an arrangement with Remgro’s aluminium door and window business Wispeco, which has been a perennially profitable performer and represents just a sliver of the investment giant’s intrinsic value.",

         "\n\nBrimstone\n\nEnduring empowerment company Brimstone holds the key to what could be an inspired food sector transaction involving fishing assets. Brimstone owns roughly a quarter of Sea Harvest and is the dominant shareholder in Oceana. These two investments represent the bulk of Brimstone’s investment portfolio, and the obvious transaction would be to simply unbundle both to shareholders. What is jamming up the value unlock is that Brimstone sits with a fair slug of debt — certainly enough to preclude unbundling both Sea Harvest and Oceana. A left-field option is for Brimstone to push for a merger between Sea Harvest and Oceana — creating a compelling fishing enterprise that spans hake, pilchards (including the Lucky Star brand), horse mackerel, fishmeal and fish oil as well as aquaculture, not to mention international interests in the US and Australia. Being punted as a black-controlled African fishing champion with global scale might placate competition authorities and allow Brimstone to sell down its stake (to other BEE entities), pay down its debt and unbundle shares in the enlarged group to its shareholders.",

The sprawling dealership network that is CMH covers almost every major vehicle brand along with the service operations and allied financial services. The group also owns a feisty car rental business that has been a star performer after Covid. Super Group, Motus and Bidvest might all conceivably be interested in grabbing CMH’s dealership network, though their enthusiasm for the car rental operations might be muted.

         "\n\nRemgro\n\nRemgro has restructured its portfolio to give a distinct bias to large unlisted investments such as Mediclinic International, Heineken Beverages, Maziv, industrial gases business Air Products and food group Siqalo. However, this has not helped to narrow the discount the market applies to the intrinsic value of the investment portfolio. Perhaps more work is needed? Merging consumer brands subsidiary RCL Foods with spreads business Siqalo is a logical next step. Certainly, there are also noncore interests that need sorting — stuff that isn’t moving the needle of Remgro’s sprawling portfolio and never will. Smaller investments such as Wispeco, the influential stakes in small business developer Business Partners and free-to-air broadcaster eMedia, as well as portfolio holdings in financial services groups Discovery and FirstRand and the legacy holding in BAT, should surely be sold off sooner rather than later. In the unlikely event of the Vodacom-Maziv merger not passing muster, the proceeds from the sale of small and noncore assets could come in handy for growth funding. Of course, old market watchers know the deal cogs grind slowly at Remgro, which is, history shows, not always a bad thing.",

But the logic is now far less compelling: As well as the gateway to selling premium spirits in Africa, Guinness has cracked non-alcoholic beer, which will become more important to drinks companies as public health policy turns to the dangers of alcohol.\n\nCan Diageo purchase the rest of Moet Hennessy without letting go of its own crown jewels?\n\nOne option is to shrink the deal by persuading LVMH to sell Diageo just the spirits business in return for, say, its minority stake in the champagne and wine businesses and a possible balancing payment.\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein suggest that if Moet Hennessy were spun out via a distribution of shares in the division to existing LVMH investors, the Arnaults and Diageo could eventually take the separately listed company private, with the Arnault family holding company Agache taking champagne and wines and Diageo acquiring spirits. Some wine assets already sit outside of Moet Hennessy. With a spinoff first, the market would determine the value, and investors would have a choice of whether to retain the shares or sell.\n\nBut why not carve up the assets at the outset?

         "Evelyn Partners Group Limited (“the Group”) announces that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Fund Solutions business, operated by Evelyn Partners Fund Solutions Limited (“EPFL”), to Thesis Holdings Limited (“Thesis”) for an undisclosed sum. The transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory conditions, is expected to complete in the first half of 2025. EPFL is a long-established provider of Fund Governance and Fund Administration services which has grown to become a leading Independent Authorised Corporate Director (ACD) to UK-domiciled funds. EPFL has Assets under Governance of £10.6 billion (as at 31 December 2024) and supports a diverse and growing book of Sponsors and Delegate relationships, comprising 161 funds across over 40 sponsors and investment managers, with a high-touch, partnership-driven approach that has led to excellent retention levels and growing new business. The transaction will see approximately 75 Evelyn Partners staff who support the EPFL business, and are predominantly based in Glasgow, transfer across to Thesis as part of EPFL on completion. Thesis is a UK-based operator of funds, established in 1997, that manages 170 funds with over £40 billion of assets. Working in partnership with a broad range of large, global asset servicers it can offer ‘open-architecture’ solutions to international fund managers. Thesis brings independent insight and vast experience that allows it to create bespoke, flexible solutions for its fund investors. With the acquisition of EPFL, it will now be able to provide even greater choice. The decision by Evelyn Partners to seek a new owner for EPFL was taken following a strategic review aimed at refocusing the Group on its core wealth management activities. On 25 November 2024, Evelyn Partners also announced the sale of its Professional Services business to funds advised by Apax Partners. Paul Geddes, Group Chief Executive of Evelyn Partners Group, commented: “The sale of EPFL to Thesis, will further streamline Evelyn Partners so that we will be focused solely on wealth management. It will also provide new opportunities for our EPFL colleagues as part of a larger, specialist fund governance business. I would like to thank our colleagues at EPFL for their commitment and professionalism and wish them well for the future as part of Thesis. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with the team, who will continue to act as ACD and Fund Administrator to numerous funds where Evelyn Partners is the delegated investment manager, providing clients with complete continuity in service.” Neil Coxhead, Chief Executive of EPFL, added: “Given its significant experience in the provision of Independent ACD services in the UK, Thesis will be an excellent owner of EPFL. The deal provides long-term clarity on our future, with increased opportunities for colleagues as part of a market leading UK asset servicing group while continuing to work with Evelyn Partners as a valued wealth management partner. As we become part of Thesis, our sponsors and delegates can expect business as usual, with the team at EPFL continuing to be based in Glasgow and focused on delivering the high standards of service and partnership-led approach to which they have become accustomed.” David Tyerman, Chief Executive of Thesis, commented: “I’m delighted to be welcoming the EPFL team to Thesis. Their reputation in the market is excellent and, like us, they have a culture founded in high-quality professional services. Having EPFL in the group increases choice for our sponsors, as well as introducing greater scale for Thesis. Ultimately this will ensure good outcomes for our fund investors.” Evelyn Partners is being advised on the transaction by Evercore, as financial adviser, and Macfarlanes as legal adviser.

         "\n\nImproved Asset Quality: BBPM's impaired loans ratio decreased to 3.2% at end-September 2024 (end-2023: 3.8%) due to active management of legacy assets and limited new impaired loan creation. The ratio should improve further towards 3% in 2025 and 2026, benefitting from the reduced stock of impaired loans and their average maturities, and the good control over new defaults, despite modest economic growth in Italy.\n\nImproving Revenue Diversification: We forecast BBPM's operating profit to hover around 3% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) over the next two years on growing commissions income, driven by the further development of fee-driven activities, and despite falling interest rates. The potential acquisition of the relatively large independent asset manager in Italy, Anima Holding S.p.A. (BBB/Stable/F3), fits in with BBPM's revenue diversification objective. We also expect operating costs to remain consistently below 60% of revenues and loan impairment charges below 20% of pre-impairment profit.\n\nSatisfactory Capital Buffers: Fitch expects BBPM's CET1 ratio, which peaked at 15.5% at end-September 2024, to decline but to remain above 15% over the next two years, including the potential impact of the pending offer to acquire Anima Holding. Capital buffers are comfortably above requirements, mainly due to improved capital generation. The CET1 ratio compares favourably with medium-sized domestic and southern European peers', while the capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans remains above similarly rated peers despite improvements (end-September 2024: 13.2%).",

He is expected to abandon a goal to scale back oil and gas production by 25 per cent by the end of the decade, a central tenet of the pivot towards greener types of energy that, as finance chief alongside Bernard Looney, he helped to set BP on the road towards. A formal target to allocate half its capital expenditure to low-carbon projects by the end of the decade is also expected to be scrapped.\n\nAuchincloss, 54, has already indicated the direction of travel. Most recently its seven offshore wind projects were carved out into a joint venture with Jera, Japan’s largest power generation company. In effect this will lower the capital expenditure to be allocated by BP to its offshore wind pipeline.

Market risk and interest-rate risks are well-managed. BNL's exposure to Italian sovereign bonds is reasonable.\n\nStructurally Improved Asset Quality: We estimate the bank's gross impaired loan ratio at about 3% at end-June 2024, broadly in line with Italy's sector average. We expect the ratio to slightly reduce further by end-2026, to below 3%, due to continued impaired loan disposals and workout.\n\nModest Profitability: BNL's operating profit/risk-weighted assets (RWA) is structurally modest. We expect it to remain just above 1% on a sustained basis, which is above its long-term average, due to a slightly better net interest margin, greater revenue synergies, and lower loan impairment charges (LICs) than ahead of its restructuring.",

         "\n\nHighlights for the half year ended December 31, 2024\n\n● On July 2, 2024, as part of the Company's previously announced strategic focus on its fast-growing business units being Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Energy Solutions, the Company announced the sale of its non-core business unit, Kenshaw Electrical, for gross consideration of approximately AU$1.2 million. ● Revenue from continuing operations increased to $0.06 million in the half year ended December 31, 2024, compared to nil in the same period of the prior year. This growth reflects the initial build-up and scaling of revenue from Tembo's operations. ● Net after-tax loss from continuing operations decreased to $6.2 million in the half year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $7.5 million in the same period of the prior year. The improvement was driven by a combination of reduced headcount, technology-enabled efficiencies, outsourcing savings, and lower non-recurring costs. ● EBITDA for the half year ended December 31, 2024, improved compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by a reduction in general and administrative expenses and minimal restructuring and other non-recurring costs recorded during the period. ● Tembo executed a definitive Business Combination Agreement with CCTS on August 29, 2024; the business combination is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the calendar year 2025, with Tembo being listed as a separate entity on the Nasdaq. ● On September 17, 2024, VivoPower announced a heads of agreement to merge with Future Automotive Solutions and Technologies Inc. (\"FAST\"), a Canadian hydrogen technology company, at a combined equity valuation of US$1.13 billion. The all-stock merger, giving VivoPower shareholders 49% ownership, is contingent on the Tembo-Cactus business combination, regulatory approvals, and a third-party fairness opinion. ● On September 17, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Chardan Capital Markets LLC for an offering of up to 10,000,000 Ordinary Shares at $1.25 per share, under the Company's Registration Statement on Form F-1 (No. 333-281065), effective August 29, 2024. The offering closed early on September 27, 2024, resulting in the issuance of 3,200,000 Ordinary Shares to institutional investors, generating approximately $4 million in gross proceeds. ● On October 3, 2024, Tembo entered into a definitive partnership agreement with Sarao Motors, the leading jeepney manufacturer in the Philippines which includes the delivery of Tembo's electric jeepney kits to Sarao's facility in Metro Manila. ● On November 14, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved an execution plan for Caret, to develop up to 55MW of its solar farm portfolio for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining. ● On November 18, 2024, Tembo secured full on-road Vehicle Type Approval (VTA) in Australia for its fully electric utility vehicle, the Tembo Tusker. ● On November 23, 2024, AWN Holdings (AWN) agreed to a 9-month grace period for the repayment of $11 million accrued interest, and a deferral of $8.9 million of principal for repayment from April 1, 2025 to January 1, 2026. This renders all but $1 million of interest non-current in nature, and $2 million of the principal loan as current as of December 2024. ● After the balance sheet date, on January 13, 2025, Caret, secured a definitive and binding investment commitment of CAD$140 million (approximately US$100 million) from GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (\"GGY\"), a Luxembourg-based alternative investment group, subject to a separate listing of Caret Digital on a Canadian stock exchange. The proceeds from this investment will be used to advance Caret's Power2X strategy, initially focusing on Dogecoin mining, while also supporting working capital and general corporate purposes.",

         "\n\nMeanwhile, Crystal Amber’s shareholders had voted for its assets to be sold and the fund to be wound up. Richard Bernstein, who heads Crystal Amber, accused De La Rue’s management of squandering cost savings with price cuts to chase volumes. He said that the management should have renegotiated its banking covenants earlier; that its professional advisers were charging too much, and that dithering about closing its Kenyan operations had lost cash. Doubts about the group’s viability threatened its current and potential contracts. He called for someone new to chair the group. Since May 2023, when Clive Whiley took over, the share price has been slowly recovering.\n\nLast July, the IC's Simon Thompson spotted that De La Rue’s directors had said that they were talking to outside parties about selling off most of the group. He said that a smart way to invest was through shares in Crystal Amber. Three months later, De La Rue announced a conditional sale of its authentication division to Crane NXT for £300mn. Debt would be paid down and the outsized pension deficit reduced. In December, the company flagged other discussions about the rest of the group. Last week, it confirmed that a bid was in the offing.\n\nDe La Rue under pressure as it awaits £300mn sale\n\nCrystal Amber owns just over 16 per cent of De La Rue, about the same as Aberforth and Schroders. These three institutions hold about half of De La Rue’s shares in issue. For Bernstein, it’s been a long haul. Once Crystal Amber manages to offload its stake, it will hold only one major investment.",

There can’t be too many unhappy shareholders at AdvTech, whose share price has soared more than 200% in five years. But there is always room for improvement, and when you have a shareholder such as Value Capital Partners on board, there might be an incentive to work harder for even better returns. The conspicuous drag on AdvTech is its resourcing (and training) segment — which, at a stretch, has only a slight strategic fit with the more profitable schools and tertiary education hubs. The uneven longer-term performance from the resourcing segment detracts from the core education businesses, which have proper moats. What’s stopping AdvTech? Perhaps finding a buyer for what is a sprawling resourcing segment that is almost certainly too large for either listed counters Primeserv or Adcorp to consider.",

         "\n\n— With The Finance Ghost\n\nArgent Industrial/Trellidor\n\nArgent now earns the bulk of its profits from a cluster of specialist engineering businesses in the UK. The group has been open about securing a listing on the LSE — most likely via a reverse-listing. UK investors would probably not be terribly interested in Argent’s South Africa-based businesses, which include fireplace maker JetMaster, Castor & Ladder and security products business Xpanda. Separating the UK and local businesses could leave the latter open to corporate action to bulk up and diversify operations. Listed safety products group Trellidor might make an obvious and interesting target for Argent — though the domination of the local security products sector might draw the ire of competition authorities. Perhaps a more inspired deal is for Argent to look at an arrangement with Remgro’s aluminium door and window business Wispeco, which has been a perennially profitable performer and represents just a sliver of the investment giant’s intrinsic value.",

         "\n\nBrimstone\n\nEnduring empowerment company Brimstone holds the key to what could be an inspired food sector transaction involving fishing assets. Brimstone owns roughly a quarter of Sea Harvest and is the dominant shareholder in Oceana. These two investments represent the bulk of Brimstone’s investment portfolio, and the obvious transaction would be to simply unbundle both to shareholders. What is jamming up the value unlock is that Brimstone sits with a fair slug of debt — certainly enough to preclude unbundling both Sea Harvest and Oceana. A left-field option is for Brimstone to push for a merger between Sea Harvest and Oceana — creating a compelling fishing enterprise that spans hake, pilchards (including the Lucky Star brand), horse mackerel, fishmeal and fish oil as well as aquaculture, not to mention international interests in the US and Australia. Being punted as a black-controlled African fishing champion with global scale might placate competition authorities and allow Brimstone to sell down its stake (to other BEE entities), pay down its debt and unbundle shares in the enlarged group to its shareholders.",

CEO and major shareholder Jebb McIntosh — a man who knows a thing or two about what drives the motor industry — is now at an age (77) where most executives call it a day. The sprawling dealership network that is CMH covers almost every major vehicle brand along with the service operations and allied financial services. The group also owns a feisty car rental business that has been a star performer after Covid. Super Group, Motus and Bidvest might all conceivably be interested in grabbing CMH’s dealership network, though their enthusiasm for the car rental operations might be muted.

         "\n\nRemgro\n\nRemgro has restructured its portfolio to give a distinct bias to large unlisted investments such as Mediclinic International, Heineken Beverages, Maziv, industrial gases business Air Products and food group Siqalo. However, this has not helped to narrow the discount the market applies to the intrinsic value of the investment portfolio. Perhaps more work is needed? Merging consumer brands subsidiary RCL Foods with spreads business Siqalo is a logical next step. Certainly, there are also noncore interests that need sorting — stuff that isn’t moving the needle of Remgro’s sprawling portfolio and never will. Smaller investments such as Wispeco, the influential stakes in small business developer Business Partners and free-to-air broadcaster eMedia, as well as portfolio holdings in financial services groups Discovery and FirstRand and the legacy holding in BAT, should surely be sold off sooner rather than later. In the unlikely event of the Vodacom-Maziv merger not passing muster, the proceeds from the sale of small and noncore assets could come in handy for growth funding. Of course, old market watchers know the deal cogs grind slowly at Remgro, which is, history shows, not always a bad thing.",

But the logic is now far less compelling: As well as the gateway to selling premium spirits in Africa, Guinness has cracked non-alcoholic beer, which will become more important to drinks companies as public health policy turns to the dangers of alcohol.\n\nCan Diageo purchase the rest of Moet Hennessy without letting go of its own crown jewels?\n\nOne option is to shrink the deal by persuading LVMH to sell Diageo just the spirits business in return for, say, its minority stake in the champagne and wine businesses and a possible balancing payment.\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein suggest that if Moet Hennessy were spun out via a distribution of shares in the division to existing LVMH investors, the Arnaults and Diageo could eventually take the separately listed company private, with the Arnault family holding company Agache taking champagne and wines and Diageo acquiring spirits. Some wine assets already sit outside of Moet Hennessy. With a spinoff first, the market would determine the value, and investors would have a choice of whether to retain the shares or sell.\n\nBut why not carve up the assets at the outset?

         "Evelyn Partners Group Limited (“the Group”) announces that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Fund Solutions business, operated by Evelyn Partners Fund Solutions Limited (“EPFL”), to Thesis Holdings Limited (“Thesis”) for an undisclosed sum. The transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory conditions, is expected to complete in the first half of 2025. EPFL is a long-established provider of Fund Governance and Fund Administration services which has grown to become a leading Independent Authorised Corporate Director (ACD) to UK-domiciled funds. EPFL has Assets under Governance of £10.6 billion (as at 31 December 2024) and supports a diverse and growing book of Sponsors and Delegate relationships, comprising 161 funds across over 40 sponsors and investment managers, with a high-touch, partnership-driven approach that has led to excellent retention levels and growing new business. The transaction will see approximately 75 Evelyn Partners staff who support the EPFL business, and are predominantly based in Glasgow, transfer across to Thesis as part of EPFL on completion. Thesis is a UK-based operator of funds, established in 1997, that manages 170 funds with over £40 billion of assets. Working in partnership with a broad range of large, global asset servicers it can offer ‘open-architecture’ solutions to international fund managers. Thesis brings independent insight and vast experience that allows it to create bespoke, flexible solutions for its fund investors. With the acquisition of EPFL, it will now be able to provide even greater choice. The decision by Evelyn Partners to seek a new owner for EPFL was taken following a strategic review aimed at refocusing the Group on its core wealth management activities. On 25 November 2024, Evelyn Partners also announced the sale of its Professional Services business to funds advised by Apax Partners. Paul Geddes, Group Chief Executive of Evelyn Partners Group, commented: “The sale of EPFL to Thesis, will further streamline Evelyn Partners so that we will be focused solely on wealth management. It will also provide new opportunities for our EPFL colleagues as part of a larger, specialist fund governance business. I would like to thank our colleagues at EPFL for their commitment and professionalism and wish them well for the future as part of Thesis. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with the team, who will continue to act as ACD and Fund Administrator to numerous funds where Evelyn Partners is the delegated investment manager, providing clients with complete continuity in service.” Neil Coxhead, Chief Executive of EPFL, added: “Given its significant experience in the provision of Independent ACD services in the UK, Thesis will be an excellent owner of EPFL. The deal provides long-term clarity on our future, with increased opportunities for colleagues as part of a market leading UK asset servicing group while continuing to work with Evelyn Partners as a valued wealth management partner. As we become part of Thesis, our sponsors and delegates can expect business as usual, with the team at EPFL continuing to be based in Glasgow and focused on delivering the high standards of service and partnership-led approach to which they have become accustomed.” David Tyerman, Chief Executive of Thesis, commented: “I’m delighted to be welcoming the EPFL team to Thesis. Their reputation in the market is excellent and, like us, they have a culture founded in high-quality professional services. Having EPFL in the group increases choice for our sponsors, as well as introducing greater scale for Thesis. Ultimately this will ensure good outcomes for our fund investors.” Evelyn Partners is being advised on the transaction by Evercore, as financial adviser, and Macfarlanes as legal adviser. Thesis is being advised by Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP on the transaction.",

         "\n\nImproved Asset Quality: BBPM's impaired loans ratio decreased to 3.2% at end-September 2024 (end-2023: 3.8%) due to active management of legacy assets and limited new impaired loan creation. The ratio should improve further towards 3% in 2025 and 2026, benefitting from the reduced stock of impaired loans and their average maturities, and the good control over new defaults, despite modest economic growth in Italy.\n\nImproving Revenue Diversification: We forecast BBPM's operating profit to hover around 3% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) over the next two years on growing commissions income, driven by the further development of fee-driven activities, and despite falling interest rates. The potential acquisition of the relatively large independent asset manager in Italy, Anima Holding S.p.A. (BBB/Stable/F3), fits in with BBPM's revenue diversification objective. We also expect operating costs to remain consistently below 60% of revenues and loan impairment charges below 20% of pre-impairment profit.\n\nSatisfactory Capital Buffers: Fitch expects BBPM's CET1 ratio, which peaked at 15.5% at end-September 2024, to decline but to remain above 15% over the next two years, including the potential impact of the pending offer to acquire Anima Holding. Capital buffers are comfortably above requirements, mainly due to improved capital generation. The CET1 ratio compares favourably with medium-sized domestic and southern European peers', while the capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans remains above similarly rated peers despite improvements (end-September 2024: 13.2%).",

He is expected to abandon a goal to scale back oil and gas production by 25 per cent by the end of the decade, a central tenet of the pivot towards greener types of energy that, as finance chief alongside Bernard Looney, he helped to set BP on the road towards. A formal target to allocate half its capital expenditure to low-carbon projects by the end of the decade is also expected to be scrapped.\n\nAuchincloss, 54, has already indicated the direction of travel. Most recently its seven offshore wind projects were carved out into a joint venture with Jera, Japan’s largest power generation company. In effect this will lower the capital expenditure to be allocated by BP to its offshore wind pipeline.

BNL's refocused business model should contribute to the containment of new impaired loans. The improving operating environment in Italy should also contribute to lower risks. Market risk and interest-rate risks are well-managed. BNL's exposure to Italian sovereign bonds is reasonable.\n\nStructurally Improved Asset Quality: We estimate the bank's gross impaired loan ratio at about 3% at end-June 2024, broadly in line with Italy's sector average. We expect the ratio to slightly reduce further by end-2026, to below 3%, due to continued impaired loan disposals and workout.\n\nModest Profitability: BNL's operating profit/risk-weighted assets (RWA) is structurally modest. We expect it to remain just above 1% on a sustained basis, which is above its long-term average, due to a slightly better net interest margin, greater revenue synergies, and lower loan impairment charges (LICs) than ahead of its restructuring.",

         "\n\nHighlights for the half year ended December 31, 2024\n\n● On July 2, 2024, as part of the Company's previously announced strategic focus on its fast-growing business units being Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Energy Solutions, the Company announced the sale of its non-core business unit, Kenshaw Electrical, for gross consideration of approximately AU$1.2 million. ● Revenue from continuing operations increased to $0.06 million in the half year ended December 31, 2024, compared to nil in the same period of the prior year. This growth reflects the initial build-up and scaling of revenue from Tembo's operations. ● Net after-tax loss from continuing operations decreased to $6.2 million in the half year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $7.5 million in the same period of the prior year. The improvement was driven by a combination of reduced headcount, technology-enabled efficiencies, outsourcing savings, and lower non-recurring costs. ● EBITDA for the half year ended December 31, 2024, improved compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by a reduction in general and administrative expenses and minimal restructuring and other non-recurring costs recorded during the period. ● Tembo executed a definitive Business Combination Agreement with CCTS on August 29, 2024; the business combination is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the calendar year 2025, with Tembo being listed as a separate entity on the Nasdaq. ● On September 17, 2024, VivoPower announced a heads of agreement to merge with Future Automotive Solutions and Technologies Inc. (\"FAST\"), a Canadian hydrogen technology company, at a combined equity valuation of US$1.13 billion. The all-stock merger, giving VivoPower shareholders 49% ownership, is contingent on the Tembo-Cactus business combination, regulatory approvals, and a third-party fairness opinion. ● On September 17, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Chardan Capital Markets LLC for an offering of up to 10,000,000 Ordinary Shares at $1.25 per share, under the Company's Registration Statement on Form F-1 (No. 333-281065), effective August 29, 2024. The offering closed early on September 27, 2024, resulting in the issuance of 3,200,000 Ordinary Shares to institutional investors, generating approximately $4 million in gross proceeds. ● On October 3, 2024, Tembo entered into a definitive partnership agreement with Sarao Motors, the leading jeepney manufacturer in the Philippines which includes the delivery of Tembo's electric jeepney kits to Sarao's facility in Metro Manila. ● On November 14, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved an execution plan for Caret, to develop up to 55MW of its solar farm portfolio for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining. ● On November 18, 2024, Tembo secured full on-road Vehicle Type Approval (VTA) in Australia for its fully electric utility vehicle, the Tembo Tusker. ● On November 23, 2024, AWN Holdings (AWN) agreed to a 9-month grace period for the repayment of $11 million accrued interest, and a deferral of $8.9 million of principal for repayment from April 1, 2025 to January 1, 2026. This renders all but $1 million of interest non-current in nature, and $2 million of the principal loan as current as of December 2024. ● After the balance sheet date, on January 13, 2025, Caret, secured a definitive and binding investment commitment of CAD$140 million (approximately US$100 million) from GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (\"GGY\"), a Luxembourg-based alternative investment group, subject to a separate listing of Caret Digital on a Canadian stock exchange. The proceeds from this investment will be used to advance Caret's Power2X strategy, initially focusing on Dogecoin mining, while also supporting working capital and general corporate purposes.",

    "1. MUST IDENTIFY AS CARVE-OUT PROSPECT:\n",
    "   - Company signals intention to divest specific business units or segments\n",
    "   - Company announces strategic refocusing that implies non-core units could be sold\n",
    "   - New strategic plans mentioning focus on specific segments (implying others might be divested)\n",
    "   - Language about simplifying corporate structure or streamlining operations\n",
    "   - References to non-core assets, underperforming units, or subscale operations\n",
    "   - Management discussing 'evaluating options' for specific business segments\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. MUST NOT BE INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS CARVE-OUT:\n",
    "   - Simple stake sales without business unit separation \n",
    "   - Private equity firms exiting investments (not corporate carve-outs)\n",
    "   - IPO plans without specific business unit divestiture\n",
    "   - Already completed carve-outs (though mention these in reasoning as potentially interesting)\n",
    "   - General M&A activity without specific divestiture signals\n",
    "   - Opinion pieces or columns without factual business announcements\n",

    "3. TIMING RELEVANCE:\n",

    "   - DE-PRIORITIZE: Already completed transactions (though note these in reasoning)\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. KEY SIGNALS OF POTENTIAL CARVE-OUTS:\n",
    "   - New CEO appointments or management changes\n",
    "   - Announcements of strategic reviews or new strategic plans\n",
    "   - Explicit focus on 'core businesses' or 'key segments'\n",
    "   - Financial pressure (debt issues, dividend concerns, performance challenges)\n",
