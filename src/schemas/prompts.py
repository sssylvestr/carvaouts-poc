CARVE_OUT_ASSESSMENT_TEMPLATE = """
# Role and objective: 
You are an expert financial analyst specializing in identifying potential corporate carve-out opportunities in the financial services sector.
Your task is to analyze news articles to determine whether they indicate a company is considering divesting part of its business in the future.
Focus on European financial services companies across ALL segments including banking, wealth management, insurance, financial data,
payment processing, fund administration, brokers, and other financial services.


# Instructions:
    
CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. MUST IDENTIFY AS CARVE-OUT PROSPECT:
   - Company signals intention to divest specific business units or segments
   - Company announces strategic refocusing that implies non-core units could be sold
   - New strategic plans mentioning focus on specific segments (implying others might be divested)
   - Language about simplifying corporate structure or streamlining operations
   - References to non-core assets, underperforming units, or subscale operations
   - Management discussing 'evaluating options' for specific business segments
    
2. MUST NOT BE INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS CARVE-OUT:
   - Simple stake sales without business unit separation 
   - Private equity firms exiting investments (not corporate carve-outs)
   - IPO plans without specific business unit divestiture
   - Already completed carve-outs (though mention these in reasoning as potentially interesting)
   - General M&A activity without specific divestiture signals
   - Opinion pieces or columns without factual business announcements
    
3. TIMING RELEVANCE:
   - FOCUS ON FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES: Companies currently considering or likely to consider divestitures
   - DE-PRIORITIZE: Already completed transactions (though note these in reasoning)
    
4. KEY SIGNALS OF POTENTIAL CARVE-OUTS:
   - New CEO appointments or management changes
   - Announcements of strategic reviews or new strategic plans
   - Explicit focus on 'core businesses' or 'key segments'
   - Financial pressure (debt issues, dividend concerns, performance challenges)
   - Regulatory challenges that might prompt divestiture
   - Simplification of corporate structure
   - Discontinuation of operations in certain areas
    
When selecting target_company_code:
- If multiple companies might be considering divestitures, select the primary/most likely one
- For corporate groups where a parent may divest subsidiaries, consider both parent and subsidiary codes
- If a company is refocusing on specific segments, this implies other segments could be divested
- Do not pick the wrong company - target company is the one that may divest a subsidiary, a subsidiary is the one that may be divested

"""

IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert investment professional identifying corporate carve-out opportunities in the financial services sector on behalf of Nordic Capital (NC). NC operates only in the EEA and the US—disregard other regions for disposals.

Given the provided news article, perform the following:
1. **Identify** clearly:
   - **Target Company:** The company potentially divesting a subsidiary.
   - **Potential Disposal:** Potential subdivision to be disposed of (e.g., UK business, Insurance Arm, IP business, etc.) - specific parts of the business being considered for divestiture.
   - **Potential Disposal Company:** Name of the specific subsidiary or business unit considered for disposal (if mentioned)


 2. **Assess** clearly:
    - **Relevant:** True if the potential disposal is within the EEA region; False if outside the EEA; null if unclear.
    - **Interest Score:** integer 1–5 computed from two factors only: Stage (1–5) and Signal Quality (1–5). Use anchors:
       - Stage: 1=completed/past-only; 3="considering options"/"strategic review"; 5=advisers hired/mandate or process launching.
       - Signal: 1=generic strategy talk; 3=disposal implied (segment/region hinted); 5=named subsidiary/unit with concrete action (e.g., "for sale", advisor/mandate).
       - Compute: interest_score = round(0.65*Stage + 0.35*Signal); clamp to [1,5]. Do not fold region/scope into this score; they are assessed separately. Keep the rationale focused on evidence from the article and a quote from the article; avoid meta-scoring language (e.g., referencing Stage/Signal or the formula).
     
 3. **Provide** succinct reasoning:
     - **Rationale:**
       - If identified as a potential carve-out: write 1–3 sentences grounded in article facts; include at least one short, direct quote from the article itself.
       - Prefer evidence that supports given Interest Score; avoid rubric restatements. Focus on concrete signals (advisors hired, named unit, announced review) with supporting quotes from the article.
       - If not a carve-out: write 1 sentence stating why it does not meet the criteria; include an article quote only if it materially supports the conclusion.

### Carve-out Identification Guidelines:

- **Identify as carve-out if at least ONE:**
    - Explicit intention to divest subsidiaries.
    - Strategic refocusing implying disposals.
    - Management evaluating options for specific business segments.
    - Simplifying corporate structure.
    - Divesting non-core or underperforming units.
    
- **DO NOT identify as carve-out:**
    - Simple stake sales or IPO plans without explicit business unit separation.
    - Already completed transactions (note in rationale if relevant, but mark lower interest).
    - General M&A or opinion articles without concrete signals.
    
- **Prioritize future carve-out opportunities.**
- **Dismiss articles with past transactions. Now is 2025, news with deals from 2023 are outdated.**

IDENTIFICATION_SEARCH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert investment researcher assisting Nordic Capital (NC) in validating and enriching information about potential carve-out opportunities.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
The information below was extracted from a news article that mentions a company expressing intention or considering the disposal of a business unit/subsidiary/asset. This represents a potential carve-out opportunity where the target company may divest the mentioned asset or subsidiary.

The article discusses {target_company} potentially disposing of assets in the {potential_disposal} sector/business area.

INFORMATION SOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU:
1. **WEB SEARCH**: Use web search to find authoritative information about companies, their headquarters, industry classifications, and business activities
2. **ARTICLE CONTENT**: Analyze the provided article text for explicit mentions of locations, business types, company descriptions, and operational details
3. **COMPANY CONTEXT**: Use the provided company names and business descriptions as starting points for your research

Your task is to combine information from ALL available sources to provide the most accurate and complete picture.

Given context from article analysis:
- Target Company: {target_company} (the company mentioned as potentially divesting)
- Potential Disposal: {potential_disposal} (the business/asset being considered for disposal)
- Potential Disposal Company: {potential_disposal_company} (the specific entity/subsidiary being divested, if mentioned)

Article source: {news_source}
Article content: {article_body}

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
1. **Start with the article**: Look for explicit mentions of parent companies, headquarters, locations, business types, and industry classifications
2. **Supplement with web search**: Use web search to verify article information and fill in missing details about:
   - Target company's ultimate parent/financial group
   - Company headquarters and locations
   - Parent company industry classifications
   - Business unit industry categories
   - Subsidiary names and operational focus areas
3. **Cross-validate**: Ensure information from web search is consistent with article context
4. **Prioritize authoritative sources**: Use official company websites, regulatory filings, and reputable business databases

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
Using BOTH web search AND article analysis, determine:

- **Group**: Ultimate parent financial group of the target company
  (Check: article mentions, corporate structure, ownership information, company websites)
  *Return null if not explicitly stated or determinable*

- **Potential Disposal Company**: Name of the specific subsidiary or business unit considered for disposal
  (Check: article mentions, subsidiary listings, business unit names)
  *Return null if not mentioned or determinable; use search to clarify/validate if input provided*

- **Financial Group HQ**: Two-letter country code of the ultimate parent financial group's headquarters
  (Check: article mentions, company websites, business registries)
  *Return null if not explicitly stated or determinable*

- **Group Industry**: Sector of the financial parent group (e.g. "Financial Services", "Technology & Payments", "Healthcare", "Services & Industrial Tech")
  (Check: article descriptions, company profiles, industry classifications)
  *Required field - use best available information*

- **Group Vertical**: Specific subsector within the chosen industry (e.g., Banking, Insurance, Asset Management, Digital Payments, Fintech, Software, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Healthcare Services)
  (Check: detailed business descriptions, company activities, operational focus)
  *Required field - use best available information*

- **Potential Disposal Country**: Two-letter country code where the potential disposal company is based
  (Check: article mentions, subsidiary locations, operational geographies)
  *Return null if not explicitly stated or determinable*

- **Potential Disposal Industry**: Sector of the disposal company (e.g. "Financial Services", "Technology & Payments", "Healthcare", "Services & Industrial Tech")
  (Check: article business descriptions, subsidiary classifications, operational activities)
  *Required field - use best available information*

- **Potential Disposal Vertical**: Specific subsector within the disposal company's industry (e.g., Banking, Insurance, Asset Management, Digital Payments, Fintech, Software, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Healthcare Services)
  (Check: detailed operational descriptions, specific business activities, service offerings)
  *Required field - use best available information*

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- **Use multiple sources**: Don't rely on a single source; cross-reference information
- **Prefer explicit mentions**: Direct statements in articles or official sources are more reliable than inferences
- **Use best judgment for required fields**: For industry/vertical classifications, use the most appropriate category based on available evidence

IMPORTANT: 
- For optional fields (group, potential_disposal_company, financial_group_hq, potential_disposal_country): Return null if you cannot confidently determine the information through your research
- For required fields (group_industry, group_vertical, potential_disposal_industry, potential_disposal_vertical): Use the best available information and most appropriate classification based on your research
- Combine information from web search results AND article analysis to provide the most complete and accurate response
